0,1,Non begginer friendly book,  I bought this book after seeing reviews but believe me its not that much good....Dont buy it if you are a beginner... Its to direct and its only for those who have a previous programming knowledge at good level.Approaches of new chapters or topics are to direct that you cant get it.They could make book more detailed version but their focus is to make it as precise as they can and as for that they made it a non begginer friendly book.I hope this would help you to choose you a better book than this.
1,5,A classic book every programmer should have on his book shelf.,  This book is written by Kernighan and Ritchie when they were developing a language for Unix systems at AT &T Bell Labs. This language is C. This was the first tutorial and C manual book that every computer enthusiastic should own. Although to read and comprehend this book a prior knowledge of programming is required but not mandatory. This book will be of great help while learning C from online tutorials .I received this book in a mint condition and delivery was very quick .
2,5,Worth Learning C From: The Best Book,"  People keep reading this book even decades after it was written. And they are right.This is the best book to learn archaic C. Get your basics right and get introduced to the language in the right way.One author of this book is the creator of the C Programming Language.The book does not spoon feed and an average or below average student with no programming experience might find it difficult to read this book. But if you believe in the hacker's approach, an adavanced student and/or experienced in some other languages, this is the best book for you. Otherwise read Kanitkar or Balaguruswamy.This book provides challenging problems after each chapter. And by solving those, you can learn a lot.This is the best book to get introduced to C. But if you already have knowledge about C, and want to write production ready code, there are other modern books written on this topic.I strongly recommend this book."
3,5,The C language,"  One of the increadible books of C, and the best part it's wrote by Dennis the C developer.According to me, book is good and it's good for all who wants to learn the basics of C language. The contents inside the book is amazing from ch.1"" A tutorial introduction"" to ch.8 ""The UNIX"".The best part* It has been closely associated with the UNIX system.*Great explanation.And at last, about book delivery it was good.But the value of this peace of art is more important, the each word of this book is like Bible world for C Learner's."
4,5,A must buy for a freelancer or future programmer!,"  This book is great for moderate programmers. If you're new to programming, try Java or Python and then get to C/C++. If you're thinking of learning C, take the basic tutorials from Codecademy.com or SoloLearn android app. This book is in great shape and the delivery was moderate with good packing.As for the book, there are a plethora of comcepts made into a compact volume, with no illustrations, so you need to bear with boring pages but it's all worth it. Happy Reading!"
5,5,Probably the best book around to start with Low Level Programming (developing native apps),"  This is the classic programming reference for C, the only one you would ever need, technically. Not at all outdated like many reviewers say, if at all, you may refer to online documentation for the parts changed. But this book has all you need to get on the right direction to learning C, written by C's great creator Dennis Ritchie.Still very useful and good guide. If you are beginning into C, give it a thorough read atleast 7-8 times, then you will be at ease with C. Reason why it's one of the most hated books is because it's much like the Linux documentation (man pages). A quick start guide, but many people prefer reading bulky reference books which try to provide solutions and examples - kinda trying to spoon feed you while this book is staright forward and very Minimalistic from that standpoint :PPaper quality is sub par, and binding and typeset is not one of the best around, though can live with it! Check pics attached to get a sort of idea of the typography and page quality (very thin pages)."
6,3,C for advanced users,  This book is better when you have already learnt c otherwise don't spend your precious money over this book buy ansi c mcgraw hill that will be your best option.Don't buy this if:1) It is your first book on c  2)Just because it is written by authors of c language itself since at that time other languages were present and this book references a lot about them.
7,2,Review is aimed at Pearson. Printing not upto mark.,"  Note: The book is definitely not for beginners. The two good book for learning C language for newbies: C Primer Plus - Prata, Programming in C - Kochan.Pages are super thin. Even a highlighter would bleed through. Pearson's books used to elude class. All that seems to have evaporated into thin air. 70 GSM print papers are thicker than this. Seemed like something churned out from a Roadside Stall Publishing Co. They could charge a fifty-hundred bucks more but at least make the book appear capable of lasting a couple of years!"
8,5,Must for every programmer!,"  The C programming language is the foundation of many programming language and once one master the C programming language, they will find is easier to learn other programming languages. The content of the book is first class as the inventor himself wrote it, it may be dense read for some but it is far superior in ideas and what could be done with C in comparison to other Indian authors. Thin book also don't intimidate by its size. Paper quality could be better but then the price is also reasonable. All in all, a must for every budding programmer or even advanced programmer to revise their basic concepts."
9,5,"A must have for all Programmers, even if they don't like C.","  Don't be deceived by the Number of Pages in this book. Even though this book covers ANSI C, this book is still the best book that can teach the concepts of C and how the Unix OS handles (in minor detail) things at the memory level.IMHO, if a programmer hasn't studied C from this book, then for me, s/he is not a programmer at all. This is the BIBLE of Programmers.Buy it, even if you don't write (or don't want to write) code in C, and then read it. You'll appreciate the inventor of C and then you'll thank me for recommending this book."
10,5,Best C programming book,"  Best book for C programming ,most recommended book if  preparing for Tier 1 and Tier 2companies and also for GATE exam ."
11,2,not up to the mark,  i have bought this book as i have seen that the author of the book is Dennis M. Ritchie (founder of C language) but no doubt he is a excellent programmer but he is not a that good writer. The book includes the data that u will get anywhere around the web.i not prefer u to purchase this book
12,5,"The book is an instruction manual of the programming language C, but it's not meant for beginners.","  The C Programming Language (2nd Edition) Book by two renowned computer scientists Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie is one of the best books on C. It covers all the aspects of the programming language, including descriptions about many features which even an experienced C programmer might not know about. In addition to this, the book also focuses on what common mistakes programmers make while writing a C program, and teaches the reader the correct implementations of the same. There are a few program-related questions at the end of many topics which help the reader understand the concepts better.This book is, however, not meant for those who do not have any previous experience with programming languages which are similar to C (for example: C++, C#, Java, Rust, etc.)"
13,5,No other book which comes even close to this master piece.,"  Of course not for beginners, one has to have a basic understanding of architecture and operating system. The most intuitive book on programming. Almost all other programming language are in some or other ways descendent of C, this book demystifies very fundamentals of how programs work. And C is very close to hardware, as Linus Torvalds says “I am yet to see a language which comes as close to C”. Written in 1989 by Masters themselves who were original creator of UNIX, this book is still the best resource to learn C."
14,5,Best book for C and also Programming in general,"  Not a beginner book for non-computer science scholars... BUT WITH SOME EFFORT, IT IS THE BEST BOOK FOR C PROGRAMMING FOR BEGINNERS.(This particular book's paper quality is a disgrace, but I'm discounting that fact given the content is so good.)"
15,1,Not for Beginners!!!,"  This book is not at all for beginners. The content is very concise and isn't enough to understand the complexity of c language. You wouldn't understand a thing if you are new to programming,and it might even demotivate you. I suggest you to pick any other beginner friendly books like yeshawant kanetkar'slet us c or balaguruswamy. I purchased it because of the hype surrounding it but I think it was a waste of money. This will only help you if you are already familiar with programming and understand basic logic."
16,5,Read it 10 or hundred times.,"  Its hould not be for beginners,although i recomend not to learn programming from books for beginners and use tutorial .once you are a bit of intermediate.then this is a must book.you will be able to writeBEAUTIFUL CODE.must read for aspiring programmers."
17,4,"Worth it? I guess not, or I guess it is. Read below.","  The pages were good, packaging was fine however the cover of book was wrinkled. You guys should improve on the handling of books. Otherwise No complaints. Recommended Books for those who already know some C or other programming language and get started with C. Books covers almost all major topics of C and explaining everything with a perspective that the reader is quite intelligent to figure it out. Would recommend 10/10. After this you may want to read something on Modern C."
18,5,Good book for C Language,  Amazon delivered the book in it's best condition. I liked it
19,1,Print quality resembling a pirated book,  The print quality resembles that of a pirated book. The pages look as if they were printed on a dot matrix printer and then photographed. I purchased the book twice from Cloudtail India and am returning it both times. Severely disappointed.
20,5,Excellent book..! Worth reading..!,  Excellent packaging.A must read book for an intermediate level programmer who wants to learn C. The language of the book is simple enough and you can say that the most important topics/concepts of C is packed in a single book of 272 pages...!
21,1,Will not recommend,"  Long back I had the book from prentice hall publications. Now I bought this book to read again and keep for reference. Font for text and code in the Pearson publication of this book is same and not pleasant for reading, also paper quality is not good. Started looking for used book from prentice hall publications. I returned the recently bought book."
22,5,Best buy..best book for beginner/intermediate level,  This is one of the purest forms available to learn C programming. Best book with crystal clear concepts and examples. Books do help.. Syntax is so well explained. If you are really looking for a good C programming book..you can give this a try..!But if you want advanced level book with lot of problems and examples then go for other books.
23,5,Book is everything you need to know about C,"  The book is made in direction of building programs by your own. Really great book. Book will change the way you code. If you aim to crack exams like GATE, this book will help to support your approach and create a strong foundation of C language. Book expects a little knowledge about programming stuff. Book is worth the price."
24,5,Every developer needs this book The C Programming Language.,"  I just love it, the Delivery.. Packing... Quality of Book... are really excellent.Every developer needs this book The C Programming Language.You can LEARN the things FROM the CREATER... JUST GO FOR THIS.Hope to continue purchaging books in Amazon."
25,3,Overall it's a good  book.,"  1. The front cover was little damaged, The packaging should we more secure.2. I was unable to find any price tag on the book, through they didn't charged more as I checked on other sites.3. The book will be little uncomfortable for beginners."
26,5,Masterpiece,  Please don't rate negatively by saying it's not beginner friendly. It's masterpiece by the creator himself. I read it back in pdf and decided to buy it even though I almost have read everything written already.
27,3,The Book's content is great but book cover had stapler holes,  The book is in good shape but I noticed removed stapler holes on all corners on the book and on both front and back covers.This particular book isn't available where I live neither new nor used so I got no choice here. Other than that everything is good.
28,3,Not for beginners,  The book is not beginner friendly first of all .You must be famaliar with programming inorder to understand it .Though the books covers minute detials that generally you might not know .Now lets talk about the physical aspects of the book .Books was in fine condition when it arrivedAll the pages were well printed .
29,4,Good but not beginner friendly!!,"  Book is very good and covers all concepts but if you are a beginner, you might not wanna go with this one.To use this book you must require some basic knowledge of the language because it contains some words that you might not understand at your first try... Otherwise book is good.."
30,4,Recommend by AICTE,  This book become recommended by every technical college in India who gives training about programming . If you want clarity then this book is for you
31,1,photocopied pages,  By content this book is undeniably the best C programming  manual but I am unhappy with the quality of pages  and print in the book.The content was photocopied and arranged and bond together.
32,1,Bad printing quality,  The print quality is very bad. The text is blur on many pages. The darkness of color is changed throughout the book. Extremely bad experience. Even replaced the book once which even had different front and back color of paper.
33,3,Ok product,  Wrote by the creators themselves. But it's just basics only. You could get more than this from YouTube. I bought it cause it's good for my strained eyes.
34,5,This is the book written by authors of C itself,  This is the book written by the author of C itself ! So cannot say a single word against this book..:)
35,4,Delivery-EXCELLENT; Product quality-POOR,"  Delivery service from Amazon - SATISFACTORY(didnt receive directly from delivery man, he passed it on to third person. Should have given to me directly)Product quality - POOR ( several pages were missing, print quality is not good )"
36,1,"Pathetic Print Quality, Pirated Copy.","  Initiated return within just 5 mins after receiving the book.  Reason ? Pathetic Quality of print, duplicate/pirated copy."
37,5,Best book to learn C programming,  Who can detail better that creator of C himself. Dennis Ritchie father of computer programming .
38,5,ok,"  Nothing great information, available in the internet, can be use to show people."
39,5,Really Great One But Not For Beginners!,"  This book is really concise and to the point. Explains all the necessary components of C language. But this book is too fast for a beginner, It assumes you know how to program.If you have not programmed before, this book is not for you."
40,4,programmer,"  I highly recomended to use this book for beginner and intermediate level of programmer .If  you are novice then it will  headache, after one month of continuous reading ,it will become your friend."
41,4,Best book to learn C language.,  Go for this book to learn in a concise manner. Exercises will help you surely. A must read book.
42,5,Brilliant,"  This book is a must buy for learning C. The best thing about it is it's not boring at all. Other books start with Variables and move slowly towards real programming which is very boring. But, this book covers all in the first chapter, so that you can do programming in C without reading the whole book. After some programming practice, the book gives in-depth details from Chapter 2. And it is to be noted that this book is written by Kernighan and Ritchie (Ritchie has made the original version of C)."
43,4,👍👏,  Amazon service is great with fast delivery and pakka packing.  I case you are beginner then this book is not for. Go for other!!
44,5,Awesome !!,"  Amazing book .. Gives an insight into how a developer thinks about a language he created , what he believes in .. And how it is shaped .. An additional resource for your language learning"
45,5,Great Documentation by the man Himseelf.,"  This is a not a textbook to learn C, rather it is kind of the official C documentation by Dennis Ritchie."
46,5,Advance book of c in Amazon foreign market,  Great book for beginners and to get more advanced on programming on C programming or start coding with this is a most advanced book in the market
47,2,product is good,  there are some concepts are missing in the bookbut overall is goodbest book for learning c language
48,5,Loved it,"  Awesome product for people who had basics in java, python or any other programming language. It works well with beginners to programming also but would keep on performing each and every program discussed in the book right from starting."
49,5,Text printing is also good. Overall you can buy it without any thought,  Book is very helpful for beginners who want to take deep knowledge of C.Quality of pages is superb.Book is handy.Text printing is also good.Overall you can buy it without any thought.
50,5,Not for beginners ..but good book,  This book is not for absolute beginners. You can go for this if u know c already and want to learn more or want to keep it for reference. Good book.
51,5,Must read,  Great book for C language learner’s. Covers all basics with easy examples
52,5,Best book,  I used to read this book online but ordered hard copy as it is one of the best books to learn c in  deepth. Not for first interaction of programming. Consider this if you have learnt a programming language before.
53,5,Nice,"  It is a nice book written in easiest way possible i highly recommend these for newbies,it helped me alot though"
54,2,Not good,  Not a book for starters or intermediate. It is just explaining some design choices pros and cons.
55,5,The only book you need !!,  Best book for C language.Complete with latest info.
56,4,Good,  The book quality was not good.but the content in the book  was explained clearly.But the book does not cover enough examples .

62,3,Printing not upto the mark,  The publising is not upto the mark. Some pages have missingle letter and some sentences are incomplete at edges of pages.
63,4,Not For Beginners,  Book is Awesome...but not for the one who don't even know about C Language...Check for Some Other Options
64,4,It just had Basics of C.,  For 200rs it's good to learn some basic of C programming.
65,5,Great Purchase,  The book was delivered in brand new condition. It is the bible of C programming.
66,5,Best ANSI C guide,  Only buy this if you have a basic understanding of the C language. It's not written for beginners trying to understand C.

74,5,The book is of decent quality,"  The book itself is of decent quality. The front cover is peeling away, but at this cheap a cost it honestly doesn't matter."
75,5,Best Book Available for C,"  This is an excellent book. Coding in C is stepping stone for being a good coder in general. If you are someone who likes things to be kept simple and systematic and love to master whatever you do, this is the best book."
76,5,Good Book,  Worth to purchase
77,5,Great book of C Programming,  Good book. As a programmer you need to have it..only this book is sufficient for your programming life.
78,5,Recommended book for learning C,"  Best book to learn the ANSI C standard, from the author himself.The book is not very big, but still covers the language nuances.If you actually complete the book, along with understanding the exercises, there would be nothing you wouldn't know to write an efficient program using C."

The book is Amazing but you cant read if you just started to learn C.  but if your pointer, dynamic memory & other concept are clear. then I recommend you this book.  honestly, i didn't read the entire book but some chapter of beginning are lovely.cons:  There is no cons but NOTE: this is not a tutorial book or not for beginners.  if your beginner then you will hate this book.  for beginners, I prefer Let us CAbout  Amazon: pro: at time NICE: cons:Nothing"
307,5,An excellent book for intermediator,  An excellent book for intermediator.WARNING: If you are  a beginner then do not start your learning with this book.
308,5,Suitable For Intermediate to Advanced users,"  This is not suitable for beginner level in my opinion sure beginner not understood a single page of program,If you know already programming and want to learn core definitely this book make you more tune yourself,it is a great reference book.Good Luck"
309,5,Five Stars,  Best book for reference & handbook use.Level : intermediate.All topic covered.
310,5,Must Have,"  Just google this book. If you have any level of interest in C, you absolutely must have this book on your shelf. This is not a book for beginners. You may ignore it today, but sooner or later, you will buy this book."
311,2,For only advanced study..,"  Book is not for beginner,,,,,For only advanced study.."
312,4,The best and fastest source to learning core C language,"  If you are interested in learning fundamentals of the C language core, this is the most authentic source from one of the creators of C. Very old but most relevant."
313,5,Best c programming book,  The best c programing book ever. Best book to be used for placements and improve your programming skills. its handy too.
314,5,Great reference book not for beginner,"  Excellent book. Note it not a dummies guide to programming. It assumes you have the basic knowledge of structural programming. C is still among the most popular programming language and  widely used across.  Since it was written by the original authors of the C language, it's hard to imagine anyone being more authoritative on the subject.I have almost 10 years of experience and I still keep referring this book. Its only 250 pages but still covers everything you need to know about C.A must have reference book in your Library."
315,5,Just CODED it....,  A great book. Any enthusiast in programming with C will just love it..!! It comes with the code and their explanation from the head to toe. It also starts with easy codes and makes it adventurous further on... But it does not come with how to execute the code given which is a bit confusing... Overall Excellent Book..!!!
316,3,"Classic Book, as goes without saying...","  Its a Classic Book...however the printing demands a lot of attention by the Indian vendor, UBSPD..the Pages are coarse, it looks like a Photocopied version of the original facsimile..which is a way to pocket the extra money by printing this classic book in such pathetic state...Hope the seller improves upon this mark.."
317,5,The Authoritative guide to C!,"  The best book if you want to learn about C.Do NOT be intimidated by it, it is not difficult to understand athough make sure you have an idea about the basics of programming(like loops,arrays etc)Its a thin book but it will tell you everything you need to know about C.Highly Recommended!"
318,4,Not For Beginners,  Although i have not read the book completely but  as far as i have gone it is clear that this is not for absolute beginners.. So if u dont know c even a little bit and willing to give it a start with this book plz dont proceed..
319,5,Standard Book For C,"  This has always been the best and most recognised book for C. No doubts, it meets all the expectations.But make sure that you sit with a pencil and paper while the book in your hands."
320,5,"Awesome book, but recommended for those who aren't a complete newbie to programming.","  This is an amazing book. The authors have done an excellent job. Each and every topic is explained in detail and is supported by and an program.Although this book is not recommended to those who have just started programming, But it is a must read for those who really want to learn C well, I am just 15 and to me this book was very readable with excellent content."
321,5,One of the few most recommended programming and software development related book,"  The classic always.One of the few most recommended programming and software development related book.I would recommend this to anyone who is getting started with programming languages.Its a pretty straight forward book actually, written by the giants itself who developed the language.Beginning programming with c language is good as it is still powerful, useful after all these years and basis of other programming languages like java, c# and others and hence would be beneficial in learning others..A must buy for intermediates, some beginners (not absolute ones), collectors.."
322,5,Five Stars,  Excellent c book. Very fast delivery.Not for beginners.Tough questions for serious people.He who reads this book with complete involvement will surely go above average in C language.
323,5,Absolutely the best,  I'm a beginner... I can say that the concepts given in this book are tough to understand for beginners like me.. I was shocked to see introduction of while loop in the very next program after hello world program...But if you do a little work you should be able to pick up the contents in this book...language used is very easy to understand... Seems like a must buy
324,5,A Masterpiece by God Himself,"  A Great Book .... Indeed, By the God himself ... the Concepts and the programs still seems new to think upon, the way it is presented might not be for a beginner, but a must to learn C programming Inside out. i went through the book, but still i learn something new whenever i read it.Amazon 5 star service delivered before time.Thankyou"
325,5,An excellent reference book,  This isn't a book for people who are writing computer programs for the first time. It's best suited for those who are interested in learning C in more detail and have had some experience with C before. The book does not explore non standard libraries.
326,4,Good enough!!!,  I won't appreciate this book to much because concepts of C only is expained here as you can't develop good programs in C.And also concepts are not explained in a way beginner needs it.But yeah! Good for third level C programmer.
327,5,Must have for learning C .,"  Provides insights as to how to write a good and efficient C code, not just something that compiles and runs, but an efficient one. Although it is just an initial step towards learning programming, it is not meant to be a first book for learning c."
328,4,Pirated!,  I received a pirated copy.. Pages and print quality is cheapest. 4 stars for content.
329,1,Please do not order Hardcover version,  Received a paper back version when a hard cover version was ordered and payment for hard cover version was made the price difference is about Rs.100
330,3,X-Ray not enabled,"  The description says X-Ray enabled. However, I couldn't find X-Ray enabled in the document. The book is no doubt the best C Reference but my review is for the Kindle format"
331,4,Four Stars,  A great book for C programming language.
332,5,Best for those who at least knw basics of C,  Not for those who dont knw anything about c.Best for those who at least knw basics of C.
333,5,review page quality,  Pages quality is very poor. Seems pirated one. But no question for study material.
334,5,Best for the price,"  Page is not that good. About book, it's new level of learning c language."
335,1,Fake publications book.,  This is not the original book. This book is pirated version of the real pearson book. There is no logo sticker of pearson and printing appears to just like xerox.
336,5,best book for C programming,  Best book to prepare for programming knowledge but u have to have some knowledge about the language u are reading ... If u have less time and need more deep concepts then go for it
337,1,Wrong book delivered,  Wrong book delivered.
338,4,Good Book...,  The book is good as expected but the quality of printed text isn't what I expected. But the contents of book is best...  A must have book if u want to perfect your c language
339,4,Four Stars,  Good book and prompt service
340,4,Four Stars,  nice
341,2,BAD PRINTING QULITY.. VERY VERY BADDDD...,  the book is good of concepts..but the matter is very short. key points are given. this is not suitable for beginers. and not well understood to new readers. but any way go for itttt... this is fully print out copyyyy...
342,4,good book for those who has the average knowledge of programming,"  Don't buy this if you are a beginner in programming or computer science.  The flow of the book is not suited for a novice, but ideal for intermediates. for average peoples this book is going to help a lot in learning to think in C, and if you want to go deeper, well there is no dearth of material, and nothing is sufficient.The explanation is good, but you need to be good at English to understand it. If you already know C and then read this book again, you will understand a lot better."
343,3,Three Stars,"  The book is great, but the print quality of this book is quite ordinary ."
344,3,Three Stars,  Not Bad.
345,3,Three Stars,  Printing quality is low.

349,5,Five Stars,  Nice.
350,2,This book is for the people who already know the ...,  This book is for the people who already know the basics of c if u are a beginner to c then dont purchase.
351,2,Pathetic Service,"  I shall never buy anything from amazon due to its worst customer service,Compare yourself with Flipkart which a lot lot better....."
352,1,Paper Quality is worst.,  If you're new to C then just don't buy it. It is very hard to understand.Paper Quality is worst.
353,5,Pinnacle of IT books,"  I don't believe a review is needed. Just buy it. I work on *nix servers, and still I read it time to time just because it is THE book. This book is like a classic tom and Jerry episode you watch regardless of your age just because how good it is. I've never seens such a concise ,yet detailed book  ever."
354,3,Very slim C book,  It covers only basic concept and hard to understand.Sample programs are difficult to understand beginners.May you must refer another book for deep c prgramming knowledge.
355,5,The book is good.. The packaging is also good,  The book is good..  The packaging is also good!!!
356,5,Best book for those who has the basics of programming,"  If you don't know anything about computer programming don't buy this book. On the contrary if you know a lot about c, still you don't buy this book. But if you are in between, definitely go for this one as this will pull you to higher levels. The flow of the book is not suited for a novice, but ideal for intermediates. The best thing is the first chapter itself gives the total taste of c. Ideal for reviewing key concepts. And  above all, it is good to look at C language from its inventors perspective..I strongly recommend it.."
357,1,"Don't buy it, it is not a beginner friendly book.",  Don't buy this book it is not something that is written for programmers I bought this book and it is still like new sitting on my desk I am not able to understand a single thing vividly related to exercises or chapters its just a lame book for beginners. It is for those who have very strong background in programming.
358,5,Not for beginners but awesome,"  Don't buy it if you are a beginner otherwise you will not even get a word out of it . Recommended if you want to improve your C programming.For beginners I will recommend ""LET US C""."
359,5,What to say the book written by the author is ...,"  What to say the book written by the author is the inventor of the C language. This book throws light on unknown deeper parts. Those who wanted to learn C, this book should be covered otherwise they miss the important parts where the others cannot mention."
360,5,Overall awesome,  That's the best book you will need to learn about c language by ANSI c and co written by Denis Retchie
361,5,Best book for intro,  This is on eof the best books for those seeking an introduction to C
362,3,overprinting,  two of the pages are overprinted ..... confused if i should replace it or not ... as the replaced one can also have the same defect
363,1,One Star,  okay
364,5,Definitely not a piece of cake for beginners but definitely excellent for indepth knowledge,  The mother of all C book. Definitely not a piece of cake for beginners but definitely excellent for indepth knowledge.
365,3,Very basic,  Good book
366,5,Five Stars,"  Great book.....Note: ""not for beginners""Fast delivery from amazon..."
367,5,It is the LOW PRICE EDITION you receive not the one in the screenshot.,"  The book is absolutely fabulous.But I want to warn the buyer before buying the book, You receive the BLUE covered Low Price Edition of Pearson, not the one shown in the screenshot"
368,5,Five Stars,  A must read for programmers
369,5,Hearing Bible from the gods themselves.,  Each line of the book is thought provoking unlike the other cliched books on C.This is a definite buy and deserves a read.

381,5,Excellent.,  Awesome.
382,5,This is not a book for beginners,  This is not a beginner book. Even in the preface its said by the authors that this book is to followed by only those who already know a programming language.
383,5,"Beautifully concise, informative description of the C programming language.","  I was handed this book (ok - then I had to get my mother to pay for it) back in 1981 when I was first exposed to UNIX and computers in my one-of-a-kind high school in Massachusetts. Previously I had been learning logo  but I really wanted to know how computers work and the C/UNIX combination is a really good way to go about it.I am rereading the book now because I just bought it for my daughter who just completed her first year of programming classes for college in the States using C++ (amazingly enough) but who will be learning C next year so she can ""learn how computers actually work"".It's hard to overstate just how good this book is. It's written by computer scientists who also grok programming, by one of the creators of the language itself. It contains countless useful bits of information you can use as a reference the rest of your life. I used to interview supposed C programmers by asking them the simple question: ""Do you know how to implement strcmp or strcpy"" and if they had ever read this book, the answer would always be yes. And if you do know how those are implemented, you are well on your way to understanding how computers do what they do, how amazing it all is.From 35+ years ago I can remember that from this book you will learn how strcmp works, how to write a simple memory allocator, how to implement printf, a beautifully simple implementation of quick sort, and how to write the stdio library, and many others. These things have all helped me be a better than average programmer with a lower average IQ than many of the people I have worked with in Silicon Valley over the years.It is a beautiful example of concise, accurate writing.And for me it also brings back incredibly fond memories of my high school years and the excitement that has continued ever since."
384,5,Definitely Recommend don't be fooled by age of the book.,"  As someone reading through this the first time it really is amazing despite the fact it was printed years ago my skill has already started increasing. The book shows you really helpful things and tips and tricks that online tutorials miss out (Not surprising since this is from the creators of the language themselves)  it is much more detailed and gives you much more useful information and functions than you'll find online, and it also give you understanding and logic behind it and explains why you do some stuff and not others. The Language used in this book is intermediate so it's not dumbed down, meaning It will not teach you programming absolutely from 0% Scratch you need to have some familiarity with the terms and ideas like Variables, Strings, Functions, Compilers all the basic things. Any basic familiarity understanding or experience in other basic languages will do like Python, Java, Lua or whatever. Other than that you should be alright and the book explains the more complex concepts and gradually you'll gain the skills needed to write more complex programs.If you want to be an expert I'd definitely recommend this book. This book also gives example programs and tutorials and explains every line it writes, but don't over explain it, as in they come back to some things later on in the book as not to distract from the main thing being taught at the point you are at. This book also tries not to do too much hand holding and gives you exercises to write programs for yourself and lets you figure out some stuff by yourself as it acknowledges that the best way to learn to program is to actually do it rather than just read about it. I haven't ran into any compatibility issues yet meaning that none of the things the books have taught me so far hasn't worked because of the age of the book, all the things I've learnt so far you are still able to apply when coding without running into errors when compiling and running, if you do they're usually minor and can be fixed with a quick google search but its rare when you do. Anyhow this book has a nice clear contents page and references to things like useful libraries and functions you can include when coding, so you can find the section relevant to you if you wish.This book also has a lot of content to cover so you'll always be learning new things and getting better, it starts of with a nice tutorial introduction to ease you in. Other books I've read on C are usually very very basic and underwhelming and you end up already knowing like 90% of the things taught, whereas this book actually shows you everything. Although don't expect it to constantly hold your hand. If you have a drive for learning and you're determined to write programs this book is definitely for you if you're lazy and want a (Learn programming language in 24hrs or 7days) guide and shortcuts this isn't for you, neither is that even realistic.I'm definitely gonna stick with this book!"
385,2,Print on Demand Disaster,"  This book, and I mean the content, is indeed one of a kind material.And that's the only reason I gave it only 2 stars and not only one star.Because this 'modern-day' product, or should I probably say by-product of print-on-demand stuff is of the worst print quality you pay at a not so cheap price here in the kingdom of ecommerce.Not even close to the original print quality of the 70s and 80s, let alone compete with the back-in-the-days quality of print.I am willing to bet that the only happy people who are happy with this cr..p print quality are the ones making a killer profit from the sale of this otherwise great book on the C programming language, because buyers of this day and age of print on demand are certainly not happy at the overpriced bad quality print.What a shame and a disgrace to the work of the creator of the C language itself..Have to return this and would not recommend anyone buy it, and not  because of the content of the book but because of the utterly disgusting print quality.You would be far better to print this from a pdf version of the original book.If you are the type of person who enjoys only high quality print and content of the book, I strongly suggest you stay away and clear of this poor print quality version.Even if you buy this out of amazon, and you see the logo of the two companies making a killer profit out of this horrible quality print, it means you are not better off .. and better double check before you throw the money at it and be royally disappointed.To add insult to this drama the package this book came with was wide open.What a shame that greed of ecommerce had to destroy such great computing books and other books."
386,4,... that such an outdated book might not be a good introduction to C,"  If you're worried that such an outdated book might not be a good introduction to C.. think again. This book isn't for people new to programming, just new to C, but this is an exciting relic even for modern day programmers. If you've ever used linux and specifically the linux terminal, you'll be pleasantly surprised to find that you'll be reimplementing some of the tools you may already be familiar with in linux. The guys that brought you the C language and the Unix operating system provide a thorough introduction to C as it was when it became the language of choice for operating systems and given how little C truly has changed in the past few decades, you'll manage to follow the examples with ease.This is a good book if you're interested in C, and a great book if you combine that with a strong interest in Linux. Otherwise, you might look elsewhere for a more modern approach to C programming. You won't find much guidance in the way of developing large software projects in C, but playing around and implementing command line tools is all here."
387,5,Useful readable standard,"  My son is currently learning to program in C. I think this book is a must for a student, as it can act as a reference when internet blogs give different advise on how to do something. As anyone who has worked professionally with C will know, some programmers will insist that the way they style their code (eg the placing of squiggly brackets and spacing) is the best way. If one uses the layout in this book, most programmers will accepted it as a reasonable layout, and as a well known standard style."
388,5,A seminal work.,"  I've been meaning to buy this book for decades. I've always had one available at work but now I have retired, I need my own copy. There is no more authentic and comprehensive text on the C language than K&R.Unlike the equivalent C++ book, this one is clear and a pleasure to read.If you program in C, you need this book on your bookshelf."
389,5,The clearest programming book ever,"  First class introduction to C, written with great clarity and brevity.  I'd forgotten how good it was until I wanted to brush up my C skills recently.  Best of all, it's not an O'Reilly-style 700 page tome, but a concise, useable book.I wish I'd never binned my original copy"
390,5,"Easy to read, very instructive!",  It really helped me to understand the fundamentals of the C language (my background is python)! The only thing I would change is to include in future editions the 'int' before the main() in the examples. Really strange that the authors didn't include it but if you try to run the examples without it you get an error.
391,3,A must have for any C programmer,"  Let's face it, if you program C you need this book on your desk at all times. It's a great concise reference of the language. However, if you're buying this book to learn C then you should probably buy another book. However, I would still recommend this because you're going to need it someday."
392,5,an absolute must for C programmers,"  The original book by the people who wrote the language. If you want to understand the language, especially the way you should think about using it, then you must read this book. I'm a professional technical author. I was once asked to rewrite this book. The only areas I could improve upon were offering an analogy that you can think of ""L values"" as the memory Locations, and ""R values"" as the Real values that are stored in the L value locations. (An explanation that should be clear when you read the section on Pointers. -- This is an absolute must have book for anyone learning or programming in C."
393,5,The Bible for the best programming language.,  Bought the Kindle version to revisit a pure language after having to endure the awful c++ until I retired. This is a book no computer programmer should be without.
394,5,THE Classic!,"  K&R is THE original Programming 'bible' of the PC/Unix age IMO.Dated? Maybe!The best C Programming tutorial? Maybe / Maybe not!A Classic IT book? Certainly!Should it be in your Programming book collection? DEFINITELY!I believe that NO professional Windows / Unix / Web programmer should be without a copy of this book (or, i believe, a passing knowledge of C) if only to realise what you owe these two guys as far modern programming Languages like Java, C++ and C#, and your career are concerned!OK, I admit it, I'm a fan!"
395,5,The first book to get when learning C,  This is the bible when it comes to learning C.  Short but packed with information and some useful algorithms.  I have a copy I bought 30 years ago and I still use it.
396,5,A thorough introduction (and reference) to the C programming language,"  This is, as of 2014, over 25 years old (and over 35 years old if you count its first edition), but there is still no better reference guide to C than this book. It is written in a clear and concise way, covers everything you should ever need to know and goes into just the right level of detail to make it by far the absolute best book available on C (with the obvious exceptions of the changes made in C99 and C11, but that can be attributed to its age and not the quality of this book).Would I recommend this book to someone just starting out to learn the basics off programming? Probably not; the book makes no point in hiding that readers should at least know the basic fundamentals of programming before attempting to read this book, and for those readers I would recommend ""C All-In-One Desk Reference for Dummies"", another truly excellent book on C. But, even for novice readers, it is still significantly better than the majority of other books available, and for slightly more advanced readers completely unbeatable.There's a reason this book served as the absolute standard on C for many years - the late Dennis Ritchie wrote the language in the first place, not just this book, and I wholeheartedly believe he left behind one of the greatest legacies in Computer Science. If you don't already own this, I can't recommend it highly enough."
397,5,"Well written  , easy to follow .","  I know this is a known as a classic ,  it's a reputation  well earned .It won't dummy guide you though , you will need to think and ask yourself  what is the code  actually saying at this line?, . Don't skim over any line  of code and assume you know what is happening . Knowing  what every command and statement means  in every line means you are learning c."
398,5,The essential book about C.,  This is surely the classic C book. I bought this one because I lent my original copy to someone else and they liked it so much that I didn't get it back!In 260 pages the authors explain exactly how C can be used to write powerful but compact programs in a language in which it is possible to do literally anything.The fact that the book is relatively brief is a huge advantage and is a pleasant change from the enormous volumes currently on offer about C++.I recommend this book to anyone learning C.
399,5,The definitive C book,  The book I remember reading when I first got in to programming - I have the paper copy bet wanted the kindle version.
400,5,Excelent book for introducing C,"  The C Programming Language is well known book for learning C. Not much can I say, beside the repeated praises. The book is an excelent introdutory book, the authors guide you through the C language in a consistent manner, from the basics (e.g., loop control, function definition, etc) trhough more advanced subjects (pointer manipulation, structure definition, etc).Throughout the book the authors take care of giving good advices in specific subjects, to prevent you from doing some well known mistakes in the future, which says much about the care the authors gave while writing an introductory book.Full of good examples, examples that are simple of understanding in nature, but not simplified (stupified) to the extent of not giving any learning base.Also, in general, the exercices are challenging and well thought.So I would recommend this book anytime for anyone trying to learn C, and trying to learn it WELL and with a strong/good foundation base."
401,5,I am so satisfied with this purchase,  I bought the Kindle edition.It is the one I used almost 30 years ago to learn programming in C. It was the bible of C Programmers then. Still is the best written by the person who invented the language. Still enjoy reading it.
402,5,Good book.,  Good book and quality
403,5,A must have for all C programmers.,  The way concepts are described here in precise language; it really solidifies core concepts.
404,5,*The* definitive guide to C.,"  Quality: Some markings in pencil and some highlightings in yellow pen, they seem to stop halfway through the book.I recommend this book to _anyone_ who wants to learn C.It's the most clear, concise (about 1/2 an inch to an inch thick) guide to C, but don't let its size concern you,it covers *everything*, even the `##` directive, which at the time of writing, cannot be found via google.The index is one of the best I've seen, the appendicies have a reference of the syntax for people who write compilers,and also has a complete review of the standard library.Everybody, beginner or expert, should have this book on their shelves.- @Gallefray"
405,4,Purchase replacement as I lost the first. It's a ...,"  Purchase replacement as I lost the first. It's a book by the creator of the C language and, therefore, a must. Personal opinion.However,  I do have a considerable collection of C and C++ books.That's the beauty of Amazon, you can purchase a whole library of books without it costing you the earth."
406,4,Well Regarded Classic Text,"  Still the best book on C from the days of C90. Just wish the authors had found the time to update it for C99/11, sadly I don't think it will happen now.You must own this book in order to be taken seriously as a C programmer."
407,1,Boring,  So much basic boring stuff in this book every one already knows...
408,5,"If you still use C, this is the book for you","  If you want to learn C and you know why you have selected C as your programming language then this is the book for you. It is NOT an introductory book to programming, one should be familiar with basic programming concepts. If you have time DON'T BUY the answer book to get the most out of it. And if you haven't read this book already, don't use it as a reference only, read from the 1st page to the last and do as many exercises as you can. Best of Luck.In authors' own words:""The book is not an introductory programming manual; it assumes some familiarity with basic programming concepts like variables, assignment statements, loops, and functions. Nonetheless, a novice programmer should be able to read along and pick up the language, although access to more knowledgeable colleague will help."""
409,5,Best textbook I bought all year,"  This is by far the most useful textbook I bought all year, and far better than the other C book I got.  Short, clear, concise and to the point.  Not the book for you if you want long wordy explanations about everything, but if you want to get lots of info fast and clearly (which also means its not a burden if you want to carry it around) then this is for you."
410,5,One of the best.,  Classic and classy technical read.  Still one of the best programming manuals out there.
411,5,concise examples for what you need and even delves quite nicely into the libraries,"  Everything (and a bit more!) about C you need to know is in this book. Purchased it for reference with a university course, it goes above and beyond to give clear, concise examples for what you need and even delves quite nicely into the libraries."
412,5,You don't know C until you read this.,"  I was under the assumption that I was really good at C programming, until i reluctantly read this book, the initial chapters are easy, but even in the easy chapters you get to learn a few concepts that you didn't know existed.For the seasoned programmer, this book acts as great refresher course, for the beginners, this book should be indispensable if you want to achieve mastery in C."
413,4,This book is quite boring to read,"  Studied C for one module at university. This book is quite boring to read, i feel like i'd struggle if i had no prior knowledge.Otherwise, it's very good and thorough, explaining concepts, providing examples and exercises (solutions i found online).Would recommend."
414,5,Five Stars,"  THE 'C' book............ simple as that really. If you don't have this in your library, you don't have 'C'."
415,3,"Ok, but anachronistic. There are better introductory books to the C programming language.","  I was both pleasantly surprised and let down by this book. On one hand it is written in a light language tone, and is easy to read and understand, contrary to many books on programming, even though it is a somewhat dry subject. But on the other hand it does not address modern software development concerns. It is stuck talking about types of problems that programmer rarely run into anymore. In the end I found other better introductions to the C programming language, e.g. Learn C The Hard Way and Head First C."
416,4,"For learning C, you'll really like this one.","  Teaches you how to think, you must buy this. More of a reference once you get the basics. Very well written and gives you some challenges."
417,5,Five Stars,  About as close to Holy Scripture as a technical book can get. Iconic.
418,4,A Classic,  This is a classic C text. I received a student edition from India with gummed stickers on front and back cover to make it clear that this was the budget edition. It's the words that count and they are well known to be excellent.
419,5,Great Foundation.,"  Really good explanation of the C language, as far as I can see, just beware for the odd thing e.g. Getline s now in the  standard library and so has to be renamed in order for the  code in exercise 1.9 to run. This leads me t believe it may be showing its age. Despite that I would recommend it."
420,5,Terse and brilliant excellence from K&R as we have come to expect ...,"  The bible of C programming, a replacement copy after someone borrowed and lost my previous copy.  Terse and brilliant excellence from K&R as we have come to expect from them."
421,3,"Compact knowledge, difficult to understand","  5 stars if you are smart, 3 stars if you are normal people like me :-(Nevertherless: a classic"
422,5,Good book,  This is a good book for learning programing language
423,5,The best book for learning C,"  I got this some weeks ago while having a programming course at uni. in which we used C. This book covers the things you need to know in order to write programs in C right away, there's some very relevant code examples in the book. Note that the book does not cover the basics of programming. The book contains more syntactic and language specific stuff rather than explaining differend programming paradigms. If you're a complete beginner you should perhaps consider another book."
424,5,great book,  good book teach you a lot of things for beginner
425,4,Good,  Nice book
426,5,Best 'C' book ever,  I first used this book in 1988 and never looked back.  Best 'C' book ever.
427,4,Good book,  Good book
428,5,A must for C,  This is a bible for pure C coding.
429,4,Must have book for most programmers,  It contains mainly the basics and it starts from scratch so I would not recommend it for someone looking for something advanced. Other than that it is well written and gives you a good introduction in C programming
430,5,Five Stars,  The definitive introduction to the core language.
431,4,Four Stars,"  A good book, but it is starting to get outdated."
432,5,Five Stars,  The classical C manual.
433,4,good book,  good
434,5,Five Stars,  A lovely addition to my book collection
435,5,A clasic.,"  The clasic K&R, my first language C book, 30 years ago. I by for souvenir."
436,5,Five Stars,"  This is a great book for anyone that is learning C, from beginners to more advanced students."
437,5,Best book for c,"  So I began learning c at uni and was struggling after coming from Java . However, this book is just golden. It explains it so simply and easily that you can't not learn c after it. It is the book for c. I promise."
438,5,awesome product,  I advice it as a manual FOR PROGRAMMERS and not for beginners. Good Explanation but (of course) uses a lot of technical words
439,5,Five Stars,  a great book for learning c programming
440,5,brill,  just what i was looking for helps a lot easy reading not for beginners though good buy good price too
441,4,A good book but...,"  This is a very well written and concise book, however it seems to be focused at people with some programming experience, which in conjunction with its slightly dated appearance could be a little off putting for those new to C."
442,5,Five Stars,  Great book.
443,5,Still relevant!,"  I was a bit reluctant at first seeing it's a really OLD book. However, it turned out to be every bit as great as all the reviews I've read before getting it."
444,5,Very good,  🐛🐛🐛🐛
445,5,Top tier,  Superb.
446,5,Programming in C,  After 3 years at university I found this book in the last semester and wished I had found it in the first. Unlike all the other programming books this actually just teaches you what and how the syntax works and is constructed. And it helped me across different languages to as I understood more. This is the bible Fact
447,4,"Clear, concise and to the point, it is ...","  Clear, concise and to the point, it is an authoritative guide to anyone who has basic exposure to programming, I had only previously done basic programming with matlab and can instantly appreciate and understand the format and jargon of the C language"
448,5,My favourite programming book,  The best programming book ever written.
449,5,The Definitive C Book,  The definitive book. A must have.
450,5,Good book,"  Very good book, useful for those who get involved with programming on UNIX style systems."
451,5,The best resource for C Programming,  Concidered to be the bible for C programmers
452,5,The `only' book to learn C from,  The `only' book to learn C from.
453,5,Five Stars,  Thank you
454,5,Still the best C programming introduction,  Masterful. Still the best C programming introduction.
455,5,Great C book!,  Classics - must have it!
456,5,Definitive,"  If you want to lean C, this is the book to buy... period! I found it easy to study and it has a comprehensive reference section. It is well-written and the material is well-explained and easy to assimilate."
457,5,Five Stars,  Very helpful with plenty of examples to try
458,5,Five Stars,"  The classic, a must have."
459,5,must have,"  the item is quite good for what it is made and it lives to its name, easy to use and quite useful. the best book ever."
460,5,Five Stars,  Brilliant book and an excellent reference for anyone interested in learning C.
461,5,Five Stars,  The best C programming book
462,5,"It should be called ""The C bible"" !!!","  Advanced, not for begginers !"
463,4,Nice book,"  This a good book, now I understand the C programming more. I do recommend this book for students who doing programming."
464,5,Five Stars,  Very good book.
465,5,Das Standardwerk zum Erlernen der Programmiersprache C,"  Dies ist kein Buch für blutige Anfänger. Es setzt voraus, dass der Leser mit dem Betriebssystem seines Rechners vertraut ist und grundlegende Kenntnisse in der formalen Logik sowie im Entwurf und Programmieren von Software besitzt.Das Buch ist gut strukturiert. Alle wichtigen Themen werden im ersten Kapitel kurz angerissen, und außer dem Was und Wie wird an vielen Stellen auch das Warum erläutert. In den folgenden Kapiteln werden dann die einzelnen Themenbereiche vertieft. Auf diese Weise kann man schon von Beginn an praktische Übungen durchführen, um ein Gefühl für die Sprache zu bekommen. Das Buch ist gespickt mit vielen praktischen Beispielen und Aufgaben zum  Selberprogramieren.  So wird am Ende jedes Kapitels das Gelernte praktisch angewendet und vertieft. Von Anfang an wird Wert auf das Einhalten von sogenannten ""good practices"" gelegt, so dass sich keine schlechten Gewohnheiten einschleichen. Auch wenn das Buch naturgemäß eher trocken formuliert, ist kommt aufgrund der geringen Redundanz im Text nie Langeweile auf.Der Autor versichert glaubhaft, dass das Buch sich an Anwender und Programmierer wendet, und nicht an Entwickler von Compilern und sonstigen Tools.Eine detaillierte Sprachreferenz bildet den Abschluss.Kurz und gut: eines der besten Bücher zum Erlernen von C überhaupt, eine klare Empfehlung."
466,5,Still the standard text for learning C,  The quality of this book cannot be overstated. Ritchie's concise elucidation is without comparison.
467,5,Absoluter Klassiker,  Ich habe mit der ersten Version (K&R-C) das C-Programmieren gelernt. Dieses Originalbuch ist leider verloren gegangen. Leider gibt es diese Version auch nicht mehr zu kaufen. Aus nostalgischen Gründen habe ich dann wenigstens die ANSI-Version gekauft. Sollte im Regal jedes C-Freaks stehen.Aber Achtung: Zum C-Lernen und insbesondere zum Lernen von C++ gibt es aktuellere Lektüre. Diese Ausgabe hat (nur noch) Nostalgiewert.
468,5,The all time classic,"  I bought this book mainly for geek reasons, mainly to ""own"" my own copy of it.It's dry, it's clean, it's written by one of the founding fathers of Unix and C(Dennis Ritchie) - basically it's an all time classic.For advanced users - it's worth owning a copy in the shelf.For beginners - some reviewers mark it as too rough for a programming basics book, but imo the ""vintage"" style makes it more appealing as it describes the foundamental concepts better.You don't necessarily have to be a C coder or want to become one to get it - its a great overall programming book."
469,5,This seriously lives up to it's praise - Best for intermediate or higher though,"  This is by far the best quality over quantity tech related book I've ever had the pleasure to read yet. Personally I came from a Python background before starting this book, and with it having such clean and easy to write programming style, I was always very intimidated by C, C++, Java, and so on. Well let me tell you this book makes C so much easier and so much less intimidating, it's still a HARD book but it's written and explained so well that with some basic programming knowledge you can learn A LOT from this book.One of my biggest struggles with Python was using it's giant library of pre-built and importable functions that are built into the language. C still has a lot of this built in, but what's different with this particular book is it really TEACHES you how to build functions and programs and breaks down every part and stage of it incredibly well (Seriously, I was blown away by the first chapter of this book which acts as a basic tutorial.)The biggest thing I've taken from starting this book is it's helped me begin to appreciate a language like Python more since it has tons of useful and already built in functions, but going back to an older language like C has opened my eyes up to programming like never before. Using modern languages is ""easier"" to learn, but if you really want to become a better programmer you need to go back to where we came from to how we got here today. Also even though I may not use C very often (I'm studying to become a Sys Admin), I feel like it's very beneficial for me to improve my programming skills as a whole and I feel like working with C so far has made working with Python even easier.In conclusion, I would highly recommend this book for someone wanting to learn C or if you have already learned one language and wanted to possibly challenge yourself by using an older language that may not be quite as elegant looking. Interestingly though, the authors make C seem incredibly clear and readable because it's all explained and written so well that you quickly forget how intimidating the language looks.10/10."
470,5,Libro muy bueno,"  Si bien no es un libro para principiantes (y los autores lo aclaran a leer el prefacio), la verdad está escrito de una forma muy sencilla, clara y directa. A diferencia de otros libros, no profundiza en el lenguaje C, pero me parece que es bueno el uso de este libro, y ya si se quiere profundizar en el tema, sería bueno revisar a otros autores como complemento.Si lo recomiendo."
471,4,Thorough but only a beginner's book if you give it time and dedication,"  I'm learning C basics as a hobby, no hurry, no deadline, but aiming to finish sometime this year (and on track.) I'm learning it to form a base for the languages that have come since, one of which I was planning on learning later. I haven't learned a programming language since Fortran.Since I want to learn fundamentals and have the time, I can go through this book as slowly as I want, take the time to try extra exercises and modifications, and work through all error messages .In that context, this is a great book for learning C. It's probably tougher slogging than books that aim to make it easy and fast to learn coding, with the tradeoff of not teaching C fundamentals. That's the impression I get having looked over some of those books for C and other languages.Some programs don't work for me as written, so having another C reference handy is important ex. the first program didn't compile as written, but after changing ""main()"" to ""int main()"" it did (although I haven't verified if that was what the correct modification for that program.) Yes, I'm at that basic a level with C, and this is has been a good reference and instructional book so far."
472,5,Un clásico,"  Este libro es conocido como ""la Biblia de C"". Uno de los autores, Dennis Ritchie, es el creador del lenguaje.Eso sí, tengan en cuenta que es un libro del año 89, por lo que sólo van a encontrar ANSI C (también llamado C89). La mayoría de compiladores de C actualmente tienen características más avanzadas añadidas en versiones posteriores del lenguaje. Los que lo quieran para desarrollar en iPhone por ejemplo, que sepan que pueden usar hasta C99. La última revisión del lenguaje es C11 (2011).Es además un buen manual para iniciarse en la programación. En los primeros capítulos se empieza desde cero: tipos de datos, estructuras de control, etc. Está escrito en inglés bastante sencillo, por tanto apto para víctimas del sistema educativo español. Ahora bien, es un poco denso para leerlo en el sofá, ya que tiene muchos ejercicios y ejemplos, por lo que es recomendable leerlo con el ordenador delante para ir haciéndolos."
473,4,"ottimo testo, di non facile lettura","  Il rapporto quantita' di informazione/numero di pagine e' pazzesco. Il rovescio della medaglia e' che i commenti ridotti all'essenziale non aiutano il lettore, si tratta quindi di un libro destinato a chi mastica gia' il C. Per il resto non c'e' niente da dire: e' scritto dai padri del C, c'e' solo da togliersi il cappello. Su consegna Amazon: libro arrivato in condizioni perfette, nei tempi previsti. Nessun elemento negativo da segnalare."
474,5,No puedes fallar,  Este libro fue escrito por uno de los inventores del lenguaje C. Así que dudo mucho que exista algún otro autor que sepa más de C que ellos.
475,5,The Bible,"  This is the ""bible"" of the C programming language, the best language there ever was, and ever will be. It's a little out of date by today's standards, where many people are programming in ISO C99 or later for the convenience factors that were brought in these later standards, but it is nice to have this historical reference. It's a clean and easy read, and explains some of the concepts in the language in a way that is easy to digest. Even if you're an experienced C programmer, you can still get something out of reading this every now and again to refresh yourself on the basics."
476,4,Old but Gold,"  This book must be present on the shelf on every tech people, not because of C itself, but because of the quality of the content. Every page is full of new information and every single chapter goes straight to the point of demonstrating what you can do with C. The authors comes clearly from another planet, and I have had this kind of feeling only with few other tech books.There's only one negative note: sometimes you have to look at external resources because the author assumes that you are already familiar with programming. Considering the book length this is ok, but I won't recommend the book to a novice programmer even if the title is quite generic."
477,2,Péssima Impressão,"  Acabei de receber o livro e me decepcionei. Não com o seu conteúdo, que já conhecia da primeira edição, mas com a impressão, que parece uma cópia reprográfica. Para um livro tão caro, eu esperava muito mais."
478,5,The bible for C programming.,  Fantastic book that is a must-have for any C programmer.  K&R is an absolute classic.  Beware that the 3rd party sellers are basically doing self-printed PDFs.  The text quality is not where it should be.
479,5,empfehlenswert,"  gut zum nachschlagen aber auch sehr gut zum lernen. neue funktionen werden in einer super reihenfolge vorgestellt so das man auch gleich einen praktischen zusammenhang vermittelt bekommt. das buch ist nicht mit sourcecode überladen. bis auf ein paar kleine ausreisser wird der zu lernende syntax in codesnipsel veranschaulicht.in den kapiteln werden alle funktionen umfangreich vorgestelln, oft sogar die vor und dachteile zu ähnlichen syntax erwähnt.die wichtigen eigenschaften werden oft zweimal erwähnt also überlesen geht somit nur schwer.im umfangreichen anhang gibts noch viel hintergrundwissen für hardcore programmieren. somit werden ""neueinster"" in den kapiteln nicht gleich überfordert.für neueinsterger in C is dieses buch geeignet aber sie sollten in jeden fall etwas erfahrung in programmierung mitbring.perfekt für leicht fortgeschrittene bis profi"
480,5,Great Book,"  In my opinion, this book provides an excellent overview of the C programming language - as one would expect from these authors. I found the book to be short and dense, with lots of example code to study and learn from. As someone with a professional background in embedded and low-level programming, I found it helpful for strengthening my understanding of programming fundamentals."
481,5,La (ottima) base essenziale,"  Non posso che confermare quello che è già a conoscenza di molti: si tratta di un testo fondamentale per chi vuole imparare a programmare in C, sia perché proviene dagli autori del linguaggio stesso, sia perché è chiaro e lineare.Diversamente da quanto si possa credere, se masticate un po' l'inglese, è più semplice da leggere la versione originale della traduzione italiana."
482,5,Hace muchos años que quería leerlo,  Este libro tan antiguo sigue siendo vigente. Va al grano y aporta los conocimientos necesarios para iniciar con el pie derecho en el aprendizaje de C
483,5,La definición del estandar.,"  En mi opnión este es uno de los libros de cabecera que un programador debería tener. Los lenguajes actuales de alto nivel han hecho obviar una serie de conceptos como los punteros, la gestión de memoría, las estructuras y el manejo de variables a nivel de bits. Este libro ayuda a saber lo que ocurre tras las fachada de modernidad. Contiene la definición del estandar ANSI C de 1988 (apenas modificado desde la primera edición, de 1983); asegurando que lo que programas en este lenguaje puede compilarse practicamente en cualquier plataforma."
484,3,"Books is great, print is sub-par","  The book itself and the content is great, though the printed text on pages is sub-par quality, it looks as if the book is a scan that has then been reprinted, and sometimes fades between black and light grey, making the text harder to read at times."
485,4,"Gran libro, penosa calidad de impresión","  Solo quiero comentar que la calidad de la impresión es muy mala (encima el libro no se vende barato), es como una mala fotocopia de la edición original hecha de otra fotocopia. Además, apenas han dejado márgenes en las páginas. No es solo cosa de mi ejemplar, he visto también alguna otra opinión sobre el asunto en amazon.com. Y la mía no es una edición india, sino impresa en Estados Unidos en 2012."
486,5,Good,"  Brief, concise but packing a lot of good stuff (if you read carefully and focus on everything they say).I have not finished it yet, but so far it is a very helpful read."
487,5,"A classic, but not useful for the beginner",  This book is a classic explanation of the C language from the top brass themselves. This book was bought as a decorative piece and these days is good for that purpose only. This book is certainly not for anyone learning the language. There are far better instructive books out there for a better price. No C reference collection is complete without this decorative piece.
488,5,The Bible!,"  This book is the bible for every C programmer. Sure C has changed over the years, but this is definitely the point to start from. The book is not very long but it contains everything you need to know, from the very  creators of the language."
489,5,De lectura obligada,"  Una auténtica joya de la programación.  De lectura obligada para cualquier programador que se precie. Llegó 10 días antes de lo previsto y en perfecto estado. Tuve mis reticencias porqué el vendedor no tenía ninguna valoración, pero no ha habido problema alguno."
490,5,Geek cred,"  Just put this on your shelf for +100 geek cred points. Right next to the Slackware and OpenBSD books.If you're younger, there are probably easier books to read and more specific to your requirements (embedded, GNU etc)."
491,5,Lenguaje de programación,  Buen libro si estás estudiando ingeniería informática y quieres ampliar conocimiento.
492,5,The best basics for C from the godfathers,  The godfather of C programming. I ordered this book to study again C. I think there is not a better book then this to start from zero.
493,5,using its most recommended guide? At the very least,"  Classic. C isn't as attractive to new programmers as it is used to be and that's regrettable. Things at the low-level are fascinating and more importantly, everywhere. Knowing how to approach embedded systems will only make you a more mindful programmer. So why not learn C, the most widely used systems language today, using its most recommended guide ? At the very least, you will learn how clear procedural code can be and maybe even learn to solve computational problems in very constrained environments."
494,5,Die C Bibel ;o),"  Ein muss für den C Programmierer, von den machen der Programmiersprache höchstselbst."
495,5,Das C Standardwerk,"  Geschrieben von den Vätern der Sprache ""C"" …Aber im Vergleich zum C++ Buch (von Stroustrup) leicht leserlich und verständlich . Sonst gibt es nicht viel mehr dazu zu sagen."
496,5,Sehr gut,  Bin super zufrieden mit dem Buch :)
497,5,A good start to programming.,  A good start to programming.
498,5,great,  thank you very much
499,4,"Bis auf Verpackung, top","  Das Buch kam verpackt in einer Folie in einem gewöhnlichen Paket. Das Paket war leicht angeschlagen und die Folie klebrig und ekelhaft. Das Buch an sich ist aber in einem top Zustand, nur die obere rechte Ecke ist eingeknickt"
500,5,Livro obrigatório para desenvolvedores C,"  Livro escrito pelos criadores da linguagem C. Ter um livro desse na estante, além de muito útil é também uma honra."
501,4,Great exercises and examples.,"  Really useful content especially the exercises. No mistakes in code so far unlike most other programming books I've purchased, probably because contemporary authors and publishers don't proof read 'like they did in the good old days'. Down side is the paper and binding quality. I expected better quality for the price but am happy to have the book."
502,5,Very Good,  The official and complete volume of everything there's to know about Ansi C. Updated and very useful!There's also a nice introduction of the Standard Library.
503,5,Best non-fiction I've ever read,"  It is hard to say something new about a book widely regarded as the golden standard for CS publications. Clear and concise examples and explanations demonstrate authors' finesse in both C and English. Thoughtful exercises which are never too easy and never too hard are exceptionally helpful. Take your time and do them all.This is a must-read not only for every programmer, but also for those authors who seek to improve their writing style."
504,4,Not easy to understand though very well recommended!,  This book is not for beginner. I am lost from chapter 4 onwards. I will revisit this book for sure after picking up the basics from other simpler book.
505,1,Counterfeit...,  The book is great a classic without a doubt. But it is a counterfeit. It is a print of a scan.
506,5,Un clásico,"  Adquirido para ""colección"" esta es una de las pequeñas biblias que todo informático debería leer y tener. Aunque escrito hace muchos años, sigue siendo posiblemente el manual de C más sencillo escrito hasta la fecha."
507,5,Great book! Great seller! Fast shipping!!,"  Fast shipping! (arrived earlier than expected), great price for the item too! This was hailed as THE book on C programming and so far it has proven well worth it! Let's you jump right in and start coding right away and at a good pace! I recommend it to anyone looking to learn C programming!"
508,5,Wonderfully concise and informative,"  Concise, straight-forward. Few people can teach programming concepts as elegantly as these two can. A classic book, and well-worth the read."
509,5,DAS Buch wenn es um die C-Programmiersprache geht.,"  Hier gibt es eigentlich nicht viel zu sagen, das Buch ist super um Einblicke in die C-Programmierung zu bekommen oder um seine Kenntnisse zu vertiefen und aufzufrischen. Es ist klar geschrieben und von einem der Entwickler der Sprache selbst, es sollte eig. bei jedem C-Programmierer im Regal stehen."
510,5,C - Die Mutter/Der Vater aller Programmiersprachen,"  Zu diesem Buch braucht man eigentlich nicht viel zu schreiben.""C"" von den Erdenkern/Erfindern dieser Sprache zu lernen ist immer noch derbeste Weg. Der beste Weg != der einfachste Weg. Aber das Ergebnis ist das,was zählt. Im Besten man lernt ""C"" in Zusammenhang mit UNIX/Linux.Viel Spass dabei/damit!"
511,4,Classic,  Teaches the basics well and is excellent for reference if you just forgot something and need a quick reminder. Every computer science and engineering student should have one of this book.
512,5,C Programming Language,"  If you programming in C, then this is a most have reference, tutorial and companion. Throughout this book there are several algorithms which help any novice programmer understand the basic concepts and benefits of programming in C; as well as using Unix."
513,3,Impression et papier de mauvaise qualité.,  Impression de faible qualité. Bon contenu.
514,4,El Quijote de la programación.,"  Como el Quijote de la programación, casi todo el mundo lo conoce pero al final casi de la nueva generacion lo ha leido."
515,4,Ottimo ma a volte molto superficiale,  Il libro è sicuramente da leggere se si vuole imparare il linguaggio C.Ma non è consigliato per chi stai incominciando a programmare
516,5,Lo necesitaba.,  estoy estudiando telecomunicaciones y este libro me es muy necesario para hacer programas de ordenador. estoy aprendiendo mucho con este libro.
517,5,Great,  Came timely and as advertised
518,4,Rest in pease Dennis Ritchie!,  Tiny book with an introduction to C from 1988. Other books about C could be better and handle the range of subject in more detail!I bought this book as Dennis died last month. He was the grandfather of C and Unix. He was an idol!
519,5,Simply indispensable,"  If you are in any introductory Computer Science course, you are going to want a copy of this book. It's a quick and concise go-to manual that tells you exactly what you want to know without any fluff. Probably not a ""lecture replacement"" though, since again, it skips over theory and gets right to implementation, and ""theory"" is probably what you'll be tested on."
520,5,Excelete Recurso Didático,"  Recomendado para professores e programadores, independente do nível de conhecimento. É excelente referência como boa prática de programação em qualquer linguagem, não só C."
521,5,imprescindible,"  Si también has intentado otros libros de C y has muerto de aburrimiento en el proceso, este libro te gustará.Explica punteros de una manera concisa pero muy completa. Ayuda a entender la librería estándar cómodamente.Muy bien."
522,5,Awesome Book!,  I learned programming with this book. It's hard but you learn sooo much by doing these exercises.Definitely recommend this!
523,5,Fantastic C programming book,"  This book is well written and easy to follow with examples.If you want to know if you can do something in C, it's a quick look.This little tool is not a monstrosity of a book, but filled with more than enough information.I feel this is one of the few programming books worth having in my library."
524,4,barely used it there but it seems simple and good.,"  Needed it for school, barely used it there but it seems simple and good."
525,5,It is a must have. A masterpiece of informatic history.,"  Who ever does C, has to have this booklet. It is a peace of informatic history, you should have aside your keyboard. It always reminds me to my early couses at the university."
526,5,Masterpiece of C,  Simple and great guide to learn basics and to use good principles to programming in C.
527,5,Fantastic all around C book,"  What can I say, this is ""the"" C programming book; you can't get much closer to the source than Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan. Informative chapters with useful exercises, and a great reference section.Some things are a touch dated, but what else do you expect."
528,5,El libro que todo programador debería tener,"  Es un clásico que ya tuve ocasión de empollarme de pe a pa cuando hice la carrera, y que ahora he adquirido como tributo, quizás tardío, a la muerte de Dennis Ritchie."
529,5,Must read,  This book is a classic one
530,5,The roots of C language,"  O livro é muito simples, sucinto até. Ainda assim, muito preciso."
531,5,Si quieres aprender C compra este libro.,"  Quién mejor para enseñar un lenguaje de programación que el que lo ha diseñado, ¿no? Estilo conciso , quizás demasiado."
532,2,Cheap Indian print,  It's a low quality Indian import. The letters are smeared all over the place.
533,5,Perfect for referencing concepts and built-in functions of C,  Came in great condition
534,5,Five Stars,  K&R as expected
535,4,Four Stars,  Love it .
536,5,Libro básico para aprender C,"  Un libro clásico y de los mejores que hay para iniciarse en C, hecho por sus creadores. Imprescindible y fácil de leer."
537,5,Un clásico para aprender a programar en C,  Si estás aprendiendo a programar en C es una lectura obligatoria.
538,5,Well written and easy to follow,  Excellent book for those wanting to explore C coding
539,5,Five Stars,  Very clear book helped me a lot to review my notes.
540,4,"The Bible of ANSI C, a must buy !","  I have just started a 'c' programming course, with no knowledge of how in-depth I would have to go to learn it, I started to loose pace a bit, until I bought this book on recommendation from my lecturer , all I don't understand is clearly and logically mapped out in the book.I have read several Sams 'how to in 24 hrs...'books, the most recient being 'Beginning Programming' another must read before anyone enters the programming world, I chose 'c' and 'c++' because of its speed over basic, which I already know well. I hope to write applications very soon with this book.I have applied for the 'C Answer Book', which I hope will complete the resource, I do agree though it should be part of a package together.Anyone interested in trying it out should buy 'C++ Builder 5 Starter pack' from Macmillan which has a very good compiler and libary files for creating DOS, Windows 16 and 32bit applications, and then read 'The C Programming Language'K & R afterwards.I would like to see Kerninghan and Ritchies books bundled with a c-compiler, this would set a high standard throughout the industry."
541,1,Picture does not match,  I received a version only sold in India (a green cover explicitly saying the book cannot be sold outside India). Not content with material quality.
542,5,Excellent book about good oldie C,  It includes from the basics to the unix peculiarities.The K&R is a book that can not be missing  in a programmer's library.
543,4,Casi perfecto.,"  El libro ha llegado en un estado excelente. La única lacra es que se suponía que era de tapa dura, y al final resultó no serlo."
544,5,Simply the best,  The best C programming book in history. The K&R is a must have for every C programmer and UNIX sysadmin.
545,5,Un clásico,  Un clásico
546,5,I'm studying because it helps me to keep my brain active while I'm retired,  Still studying
547,5,Great reference,  Every great reference for beginner programers
548,4,Très bon livre,  Très bon livre qui donne vraiment les bases du C.Seul défaut la couverture un peu trop souple qui ne protège pas assez le livre.Sinon tout est ok !
549,5,"Sehr gutes Buch. Man braucht ein bisschen Ahnung von Programmierung, bevor man es liest.","  Das Buch hqt mir sehr gefallen.  Mit etwas konnte einige schwere Themen verstehen.Sicherlich für jedem zu empfehlen,  der sich nit C befasst."
550,4,C Programming Language Review,"  Very in-depth and an excellent book on the C language, but the difficulty level is somewhat on the more complicated side"
551,5,Must have C bible.,  My professors swear by this book and recommend it to all their students.
552,5,A must-have!,  This is a must-have book for learning C. It is very descriptive and helpful for all computer scientists.
553,5,Good Resource book,  Saved me a couple times for key-words in my Software Development class.
554,5,Five Stars,  excellent book
555,4,Fine enough,  Poor print and paper quality. Cheap book though so....
556,5,Five Stars,  good entry level book.
557,5,Five Stars,  This book is about C.
558,5,Got to love it,"  This book is well written and I think that every one who codes in C needs to have this book, even if it's not perfect ..."
559,5,Five Stars,  Conforme et dans les temps
560,5,Christmas gift,  This book was specifically requested for work and was gratefully received
561,5,The C Programmers Bible,  The Bible of those who program in C. Excellent reference book
562,5,Must Have,  Dieses Buch ist ein absolutes Must-Have fuer jeden C-Programierer.Hintergruende zur Entstehung und Entwicklung der Programmiersprache C werden ausfuehrlich erklaert.
563,5,Five Stars,  Still the best.
564,5,Five Stars,  Perfect reference book for coding in C
565,5,Glad I picked this up,  An essential for C coders
566,4,"Inhalt sehr gut, aber...","  leider die Version für den indischen Markt erhalten. Dementsprechend ist auch die Qualität des Drucks, des Papiers sowie des Einbands."
567,5,Must have!,"  J'ai appris plus de choses en lisant ce livre qu'en 4 ans de programmation en C. Sans mentir, si vous n'avez pas lu ce livre, vous manquez quelque chose d'essentiel.Bon, faut aimer le C, hein..."
568,5,Good used book seller,"  Good book, and good service from the vendor. Thanks."
569,3,classic but dated,"  It's the bible for sure, but not good for learning. Have a copy for your second C book if you want to get serious down the road."
570,5,The C bible,"  This is simply the best book in C programming language. If you want or need to write C programs, you must read this book until the end. Buy it and read it: you shall not regret."
571,5,Five Stars,"  Great book, fast shipping."
572,5,Five Stars,  Great!
573,5,Five Stars,  Book arrived in good condition. Thank you.
574,5,Five Stars,  nice book
575,4,Four Stars,"  good condition, thank you"
576,5,Five Stars,  good
577,5,Excellent !,  On apprend bien plus en lisant ce livre que des tutoriels internet ! Je recommande ce livre a quiconque veut se lancer dans la programmation en C.
578,5,Simply the Best.,"  Regarded by many as The Bible for learning C programming & rightly so.Written by the man who wrote the language, so what more of an authority could you ask for?I'm working my way, admittedly slowly,  through this book to learn the C language.The examples and the now try this tasks ( in every chapter ) are excellently designed to drive home the principles being taught.Extensively proofread, if I'm not getting something, I know a little bit more attention will see it through, because it's me,it's not just a mistake in the book. ( My pet hate when trying to learn anything new. )Follows the C standard exactly, no need to worry about it being in any way out of date as it is an older publication.This is true to such an extent that I am now 3/4 of the way through and have run every tutorial andexample so far on a MacBook Pro, using the latest version, currently  v9.1,  of Apples free XCODE development IDE.Delighted I bought this. Not too cheap but certainly an investment.If you found my review useful, please hit 'like', if not, Meh."
579,3,Not for beginners,"  This is not the best book for those learning to program in C. It is probrably best suited for those who already have a little programming experience. The constructs are not always well presented and the examples suffer from being too computer science oriented (e.g. counting words in a sentence).Overall, not exactly a tutorial or a reference but does provide a few pointers for intermediate level C programmers."
580,5,"Es ""El libro"" de C","  Es el libro del ""coinventor"" del lenguaje C, ¿qué se puede decir más allá de eso? Obviamente no es muy extenso y especializado, de hecho, yo lo he comprado como un homenaje tras su muerte en 2011."
581,3,Great book horrible cover,"  This is an excellent book for anyone. Even if you think you know C well it is still a great resource to have as the definitive 'C bible'.Unfortunately the copy I received is not the one as in the product description (the normal second edition with a white cover). I received and ""Eastern Economy Edition"" from Astarbookshop which has a truly awful pale green cover. It sounds trivial but it is such a horrific eyesore that I would not want to keep it on my bookshelf.It's a great book but I'm extremely disappointed that the copy I received is so tremendously ugly and not as described."
582,5,"If you want to learn C, you must read this book","  This is one of the standard references on the C programming language.  One of the creators of the language is one of the authors of this book.  Although it is very old, you need to read this book before reading more modern books.  Make sure you do the exercises in it."
583,5,Fantastic,"  Great book, well worth your while grabbing a second hand copy, maybe not the full price version given the fact you can probably find a pdf online."
584,5,プログラム作者の読むべき本,  　英語の勉強も兼ねて原著を中古で買いました。　著者も書いてありますが、プログラミングの入門書というよりも、入門程度の知識は持った人が更に知識を深めるという位置づけの本の様です。例題は、自分で全て解くのは難しいと思いますので、より知識を深めたい方はアンサー・ブック（例題の回答集）を買う事をお勧めします。　内容ですが、段階的に説明され、参考プログラムものっていますのでとても分かりやすいです。手品的な文法も詳しく解説してあり、その解析プログラムものっています。C言語でわからない事があったり、更に詳しくなりたい方はぜひ読む事をお勧めします。
585,5,Five Stars,  Great !
586,5,Easy to read! Highly Suggested book!,  Bought used. Great book! Easy to read.Explains quite well in an orderly manner.Great examples.
587,5,初心者以外はじっくり読め,  和訳はずいぶん前に読んでいたのですが原著を読んだのは最近です．和訳でも十分に役立ってたんですが，原著はそれに輪を書けて素晴らしい．和訳のまずさも実感できました．基本的には和訳と同じ内容なのでプログラミングや計算機の初心者にはチンプンカンプンの内容だと思います．しかし，基本的なリテラシー(原理の概要の知識とか何らかのプログラミングの経験)がある人には自信を持って勧められます．要領を得ている，網羅的，手本として役立つ，辞書的な使い方ができる．これだけ素晴らしいCの教科書は本は他に無い．ただし，繰り返しになりますが，初心者にはチンプンカンプンだと思います．C言語以外の一般的な知識が仮定されているので．
588,2,Its very old school - which is not necessarily bad,"  I should of known better. Been coding for years, this is coding utilizing as much cleverness in one line of code as you can.Thats the old school way. I respect that and they are very good at it. The new school is coding things in a way that is expressive and mitigates risks of both the code itself and of the person consuming it.This book was written not to explain how to use the langauge professionally but as a great explanation of how to code in it. They are worlds apart in my opinion. If you are on your own or learning to code this book is great - eg as a textbook. If you are wanting to know how to use C in a development team and not annoy people then maybe this book is not for you.However you have to start programming somewhere, if c is your first langauge then this book is probably a really good starting point. Otherwise you will be reading it very quickly and pulling faces at the density of soem of the code examples - wanting to pull things apart to make it clear what your intention is."
589,5,Produit Excellant,  Je suis très satisfait du produit et de la qualité de service client chez Amazon.C'est mon site préféré point de vue pris et qualité de produit proposer.
590,5,バイブル,  内容は時代遅れですが、プログラマで食っていくという目標を持っているかたは、歴史的読み物として読んでおいた方が良いと思います。
591,2,The C programming Language,  Well it did not fit my expectations some examples were not explained fully so I kept on looking for other books
592,5,must-have fuer jede IT-Bibliothek,"  Steht bei mir zwischen ""The Minimum You need to know to be an OpenVMS Programmer"", ""Operating Systems - Design and Concept"" und ich hab bis heut nicht verstanden, wofuer pointer sind. Also hab ichs noch nicht genug verinnerlicht..."
593,1,Brutta esperienza.,"  Il libro che ho ricevuto è una fotocopia rilegata, anche di cattiva qualità.Mi sembra davvero una brutta storia.  Non consigliato."
594,1,Misleading Picture,"  What is being sold here is an Indian edition (legally only allowed to be sold in India and environs) and has an unpleasant green cover, it is certainly not the book in the picture.  The contents seem OK but I cannot be certain of it."
595,5,Programming Language,"  ..,weil unsere Erwartung entspricht und damit sind wir zu Frieden.und das ist alles, dass ich sagen kann.Beste GrüßeNauzad"
596,5,"An absolute classic, but still as relevant as ever","  I should start by saying that I am not a novice developer.  Nor free from the bias of academic training. I first got acquainted with the C programming language years ago before I started school. I found it to be too difficult for a complete beginner so I put it to the side and tried my hand at Java, Python, JavaScript and then PHP. While it has taken me many years to comfortably sit down to pick this book and comfortably work through the exercises I can say one thing: This is not a book for beginners in programming or computer science. Beginners in C? Sure, but most will absolutely need to have a solid grasp of computer programming and a little Computer Science theory before they can appreciate everything in the book.Some users here have mentioned that the authors were absolute legends in the fields, but bad teachers. I respectfully disagree. While I don't think that their style of teaching is for everyone, I will say that it is by no means a reflection of them being bad teachers. I have not seen a single exercise that cannot be solved with the provided material in one way or another, the real challenge? More experienced developers will know that there are other functions or constructs that can better solve the exercise at hand without making it far as manual as they would normally be, yet the trick and learning experience is in doing each one of them with the provided material, and to drive the point even further come back right after you are done with the book to keep playing. It is the only real way to work with a language such as C.Are you a total novice? Absolutely nothing wrong with that, but do save yourself the headache and start somewhere else,  C Programming Absolute Beginner's Guide by Greg Perry is an excellent choice, another great book is Head First C. Once you are done with them, then come back, purchase this absolute gem of a book, and get you more well acquainted with what might be the most important programming language in the entire world, shown to you by the creators themselves."
597,1,One Star,  Very bad quality. Pages are falling out. :(
598,5,It doesn't get much better than this,"  I'm not new to programming; in fact I've been doing it professionally for the past decade. Although I've played around in quite a few different languages, most of my work over the last 6 years has been in .NET (C# mainly). I have always had an interest in C because I love its simplicity. Also, it's a language which brings one closer to the machine, stripping away many of the abstractions that higher level languages provide. Higher level languages (such as Java, C#, Python, etc.) are massive and powerful with HUGE frameworks, but I'm attracted to simple things.This book is a feisty little devil! I had heard of this book before diving in (it is a classic), but its size and table of contents lead me to believe I would breeze right through it. Wrong! Picking up the syntax wasn't too difficult and I have a fairly good handle on more advanced concepts like pointers already, but this book is absolutely packed with exercises and many of them are quite challenging!Here's one:""Write a program to check a C program for syntax errors like unbalanced parenthesis, brackets and braces. Don't forget about quotes, both single and double, escape sequences, and comments.""This is a chapter 1 exercise! Chapter 1 is just a tutorial introduction chapter and this is one 1 of 24 exercises in this chapter! No wonder it takes people years to work through this tiny book. I'm only about halfway through as I write this review.This book is the perfect blend of reference material, practical knowledge and challenging exercises. There is absolutely no fluff and not a single word is wasted. I grow tired of pouring through 1,000+ page tomes. The appendices are also very well structured and extremely helpful.Although I do virtually no C coding professionally, I can say for certain that this book has leveled up my skill-set. Working through these exercises has helped me with logical thinking and having a better understanding of coding closer to the machine has improved me as a developer overall. I'm one who believes that this book is great for all programmers, even if you never write a line of C after working through this book. I'm really loving the C language!Whether you are a beginner or experienced it's worth having this book. Though this will be quite tough for total beginners, I say it's still work picking up and pairing it with a more beginner-friendly book. Unfortunately I cannot recommend such a book at this time because this is the only C book I've worked through."
599,5,"Not too basic for an intermediate/advanced programmer, that's for sure","  I've been programming in C for almost five years now and while that certainly doesn't make me an expert, I was hesitant to by  200-something page book that was essentially an introduction to the language. Well, make no mistake, this book packs more punch pound for pound than any other book I've ever read. Not only was the book not too basic, some of the exercises are taking me way longer than my pride could have imagined. Do not hesitate to buy this book. If you love C, you'll love this book"
600,5,Classic,"  This book is certainly not for beginners, though not a requirements but at least the reader should have a background on Data Structure in order to easily follow most of the examples. The book was also structured to re-use the functions built from previous chapters like getline, atof, strcmp, alloc, etc.., though some of these functions have an equivalent in C's standard library, the authors choose to re-use it.  If you pay attention to the details on this book, you will pick-up the most important area of C that will save you from scratching your head while debugging your code like side effects of infix/postfix increments, precedence of statement evaluation etc..  The authors also discussed some of the best practices in order to optimize the use of language such as efficient manipulation of pointers, style on delaring variables and initializations. Some of the coding style of this book was also used by coding guidelines found in official website of linux kernel.  This book is commendable not only because it was written by the Kernihan and the creator of the language itself(Richie) but how the book was organized and well explained. This is a small book with big information."
601,5,I cannot explain how important this book is to any ...,"  I cannot explain how important this book is to any programmer, let alone a programmer wanting to learn C. This is one of the first books you should read, when starting any language derived from C as all are nearly syntactically identical."
602,5,THE C BIBLE,"  This is THE text on C, it's like the Bible for C programming.I found it to be a great base to ALL other languages I went on to learn - C is like the ""father language of the programming world"" as many of the pros will tell you.You can start with this book from absolutely nowhere in C programming, in fact, I think it's better if you do as I felt like I had to ""un-learn"" many bad habits.Definitely recommended for everyone by me as it teaches the language to whoever wants to learn C and gives a great base to expand from for anyone who wants to learn other programming languages."
603,5,C a la K&R!!! What else can ...,"  C from the fathers of C. This book is esther terse. However, I really like it, and that's is one of the reasons. I cuts right through the chase. It's not your regular academic book which spends 2 chapters to explain functions or loops. Instead it teaches you how to use the language without going around in circles. Although, the book is small, it still has a great deal of content in each of its chapters. Therefore, make sure you have some knowledge of some other programming language under your belt. I rate it 5 stars because it really deserves it. My only complaint is that the book started falling apart in just two weeks. But well it was a used book that looked like new initially."
604,5,A Classic C Programming text.  Readable and usable for beginner and experienced alike!,"  Hard to find, but you won't find a better introduction to C programming!  The book is easy to read, the example programs actually work, and when I first bought a copy of this book twenty-five years ago, I was able to write a C program to search a very large database and present a nicely structured screen display.  Of course, in those days, the program was running under MS-DOS and I didn't have to deal with the Windows API.  Nevertheless, Kernighan and Ritchie have written the definitive text for those who wish to learn ANSI C. If you can find one of these, get it!"
605,5,Best programming book ever.,"  Amazing book to learn C. It lives up to its reputation. The exercises are amazing. I was skeptical since it was such an old book, but many C programs still use this version of C anyway. Look no further than this book to learn C quickly and well."
606,5,Great book to learn C from,"  Great book to learn C Programming from even though it is dated (we are on C11). The information is still relevant and insightful. All you need to do is basically catch up on current standards and that is easy to do since you’ll know fundamentals. Just a reminder this book isn’t geared toward programmers that never programmed before, it is a book on C and it’s features. That’s why it’s so small! C programming books like the one by King are thick, because they go slow and explain concepts throughly which is great for beginners. Again, this book just teaches C but it does it well."
607,1,It's NOT read friendly,"  Print Type is very bad. Looks like old news paper printed on 80's.  Too much description, may be good for beginners students but not for you if want to understand the concept of C Pointer, Structure, Union, etc. in few lines. I found may online tutorials better than this book.Just read the book less-than hours and returned; Paid $7.53 shipping fee.... bad."
608,5,Informative Book,"  As a student learning C for the first time, this book and the accompanying answer book are decent books and I would recommend them.Yet despite this, I believe there are alternative books which would have made the learning experience at first much easier.If you have zero experience with programming or C in general, C Programming Absolute Beginner's Guide by Greg Perry and Dean Miller would be the best place to start.  It does not get any simpler than this and the book is written with this in mind.Head First C by David Griffiths is another recommendation which is beginner friendly.  Plenty of visual representations with a sense of humor to keep you interested.  Straight forward and easy to follow."
609,5,All good C programmers should have this book.,"  This is the definitive book for C programmers. Written by the creators of the language, this is the best reference/tutorial on how to start programming with C.  You will learn everything about the core C language in all of the ~260 pages.  I really can not express how good this book is, but be warned that it is a little on the pricey side. It's worth it."
610,4,Worth The Money,"  This book is well printed, has a complete Table of Contents, an appendix, and an index. This is my first and only recommendation for learning C ESPECIALLY as a beginner. If you’re coming from Python having good syntax might throw you off but once you adjust you will see why everyone hates writing in Python."
611,5,A Programming Classic,"  With more than 30 years under its belt, the C programming language still remains one of the most important computer languages to date.  Languages like Perl and Java might have secured permanent niches in certain areas of programming, but one must keep in mind that they their own compilers were written in C languages, and both use structures and styles derived from C.In short, this book is a classic in the field of computer programming, but it is no less relevant today.  Kernigham and Ritchie start the reader from the very beginning with discussions of variables and functions, and keep their discussion of C in very stripped down and simple terms.  Using C libraries can get you very far these days as a programmer, but if you want to know how those functions work, you will enjoy a very nice introduction in this book.  You will make your own functions like strcat, atoi and so on using the most basic C commands.  This approach to programming really helps the new programmer think for themselves.I also like the problems and questions throughout the book.  Kernigham and Ritchie definitely want the reader to be actively learning C and not just be a passive reader.In short, this book is an excellent starting point for someone wanting to learn C, or for someone who is starting out in programming.  Its also a classic that should definitely be on any career programmer's shelf."
612,4,Overpriced and slim,"  This content will be extremely useful to my son who is learning multiple computer programming languages. I was just shocked at the size of the book, considering the price. I'm a librarian so I am familiar with book costs. It should have been about 1/2 of what I paid, which was about $55. I'm sure the author(s) would disagree."
613,5,Best Book I could ask for.,  I previously bought a used copy of the first edition of this book. I can see that the second edition is much more up to date and much bigger. I use it as a reference book for when I need to see how something is done in C when I get the programming itch.
614,5,"Even 30 years later, this book is still impressively ...","  Even 30 years later, this book is still impressively relevant. The coding style may be a bit dated, but all of the core concepts of C remain the same. The book even teaches you how to implement malloc at the end! Only complaint is that the font is a little difficult to read."
615,5,Essential for any Real C Programming,"  If you've worked with C, you know it is terse, compact, and sometimes unforgiving.  This book was the de facto standard for C prior to ANSI, and after that remained pretty definitive.  This book is small, so one might mistakenly assume it is less thorough, but C is not a big language, and it doesn't need a big book.  The important thing is to understand the features that it DOES offer, because failure to get the nuances of those can be catastrophic.  I am a software engineer by trade, and use C (usually ANSI but sometimes K&R for older things) and it's still helpful to refer back to function references or the language specification.  If you need a data structures book or algorithms or some kind of guidance how to go about writing programs, there are plenty of others on those topics; this book does not (and should not) cover those.  If you need to know C and know it well, I highly recommend this.Having programmed SOMETHING is really all that one needs to understand the basics.  Having seen the UNIX/Linux system calls is helpful, but that chapter is self-contained and one can learn the rest without an issue."
616,5,A rarity: Succinct and Thorough,"  I'm new to procedural programming. I bought this book as a reference for the ANSI C language, so that I could look up various rules or constructs that might otherwise be described less thoughtfully in the various how-to books that are available for C Programming. I was not disappointed in the least.My advice to those learning C as their first programming language is to get either C for Dummies (Vol 1 & 2 are sold together on this site) or Learning to Program in C by Deitel and Deitel. The latter will certainly build your skills more, but the former makes it easier to get started and keep an interest through the first few chapters (usually the most critical ones when working with books like these). Then you can use this book as a cross-reference when something doesn't make sense to you.Even so, if I could learn from only one book, it would be this one without a doubt. It's relatively short length is one of its great strengths. Nowhere are you buried in obscure references or cryptic examples. It's all very clearly put together for the reader. No wonder it's hard to find used copies in good condition!"
617,5,Timeless. Simply Essential. Simply the Best.,"  The ""K & R"", as it is widely known has a reputation of both being the pure encapsulation of and a terse discourse in the C Language. Both characterizations have equal merit. That being said, this shockingly succinct (at only 272 pages) publication is both tutorial and reference. In short, more of the ""madness behind the method"" is covered in this tome than the unwieldy but for some reason mandated college texts from the likes of Deitel or from the more cursory ""Dummies"" efforts. From the onset, the authors waste no time jumping into each concept with solid code examples. At first these may seem a little complex and in actuality they are--many of the standard library functions are stepped through to drive across such concepts. The authors preface with ""C is not a big language"", and that is true, however when one considers how the ""B-52"" of programming languages has been the linguistic basis for the more popular Java, C# and C++ (not to mention what for Ruby, Perl and Python are implemented in) the essence of this work by the authors of the language cannot be overstated. This is written with the student of the programming art in mind, whether at the collegiate or professional level. This should be a required introduction for Comp Sci or Engineering majors to that art, and every serious programming student or practitioner should own it. Given that it still holds its original value, chances are most do. Don't let the price fool you--The C Programming Language is worth its weight in gold!"
618,5,"This book taught me C, but it also taught me how to program better than anything else.","  This book taught me C, but it also taught me how to program better than anything else. I had written thousands of lines of code by the time I read K&R. This book introduced me to elegance in programming that changed everything."
619,5,"A really good read, which is not too long","  The most famous of all C programming books, and the original publication of the hello world script. A really good read, which is not too long. I read this mainly as an intro to C. If you're serious about the language, I would definitely consider following this up with a more recent book. The 2nd edition covers 'ANSI C' but since its publication the language has progressed to different 'ISO' specs. There are some differences, but for the most part, this is a good place to start and should definitely be on any programmer's reading list in my opinion."
620,4,It's the standard for a reason.,"  Nothing but praise for this book, for the most part.  I can certainly see why it's the 'go to' book for C programming.  While it does assume some semi-unrealistic levels of knowledge in some places (bitwise operations, for example), it is for the most part very plainly written and, provided you concentrate hard enough, understandable.  I found a few minor typos in the Kindle version, but other than that I have no real major complaints.  All of the examples provided are compact and concise, and each serves to demonstrate an important aspect of the programming language.  The one main drawback is that you can speed through a large amount of content very quickly and wind up overwhelming yourself if you don't stop and take breaks from reading to apply and reinforce what you've just covered by actually attempting to write programs.  For ambitious readers, however, this is basically the perfect book."
621,5,One of the Great Programming Books,"  I've used several programming books to teach me languages.  First it was the ""Learning Perl"" and ""Programming Perl"" books from O'Reilly.  Then we had ""C++: How to Program"", from Deitel and Deitel.  But none of those can come close to this book.K&R manages to teach an entire programming language in but a few lessons.  As they say, C is a small language: it doesn't need a 1000 page book!  Short, easy-to-understand, and right to the point, this books teaches the syntax of C, the usage of C, common paradigms of C, and so on.  Possibly confusing practices ( while((int c = getchar()) != EOF) ) are well-explained, and you come away with a fantastic foundation of this language.The exercise are fantastic, and some are quite difficult, forcing you to think and apply yourself.  My one complaint is that solutions are not provided, but these are easily found online.Even once you've read this book, it can be a fantastic reference.  There are tomes out there dedicated to C reference, those may be better for, say, writing a kernel.  But for most people, this book works fantastically.I cannot recommend this book enough for learning C."
622,5,The Most Important Programming Book You Will Ever Own,"  This book is literally the holy grail of programming books. It never assumes you are stupid or talks down to you. It is a very small book compared to the tomes you see sitting on store shelves for most programming languages but this is because it manages to convey the information in the quickest possible manner. It has plenty of code examples for you but it doesn't ever hand you the solution to the problems it challenges you with.If you make it through this book and follow along with all the exercises and complete all the challenges then you will have a working knowledge of the C language. You might not be the greatest programmer in the world when you finish but you will have the most solid foundation possible to build upon. At first a lot of the concepts might not make sense and you may find yourself reading some chapters multiple times, I know I did. The book is challenging but like most things worth learning in life programming is not easy. Programming is a long journey and one where you never really stop learning. Everything you do in this book make seem pointless and you may think that you are doing simple tasks the long way because in some ways you are but no one ever started programming by writing a AAA application on the first try.Don't buy into books that promise to teach you how to build hardcore games or applications right off the bat. You need a foundation for that knowledge and this is where you can get it. Don't jump in the deep end of the pool before you learn to swim or you may regret that decision later.Having been programming for years this is one of the few books that I continue to carry with me and it has survived every summer cleaning of my bookshelf. It truly is an invaluable resource. I suggest you pick it up if you have any interest in programming."
623,5,"Excellent Reference, hard to work through","  Its well worth the read. I don't have a traditional CS background and it was difficult and had quite a fee somewhat archaic at parts, but the amount I learned working through this book is amazing. I'll have to take another pass at it in a few months to grasp the more obtuse parts of this book.I would say this was a book developed for more experienced programmers, it reads as if you had to know another programming language and a year of CS experience before being able to grasp all the terminology and examples."
624,4,Learn from Richie himself,"  If you are trying to learn the C language, who better to learn from than the one who invented the thing. The book has many good examples and I had little trouble reading through it for my architecture class. C can be a hard language to learn for someone used to high-level languages (Java and Python for example) so be aware of that before starting your own study if you are learning on your own.C as a language is nice for an introduction to lower level programming, especially once you start getting towards the bottom with the many different assembly languages out there. I'd recommend the book to someone who is interested in programming at a low-level and is looking to get their feet wet."
625,5,"Old, classic but really clear and helpful in C programming language study even now","  I bought this book 2 years ago and it's absolutely helpful for my academic study. My dream job is Application programmer so this book is the best guideline to me in very first steps. This book is published on April 1, 1988 but it still has been useful for me in from 2 years ago to now. Thanks to it, now I have a strong fundamental to upgrade from C to Java and then Android programming language. The book will guide you to write your very own and easy program, I still remember it and I think if you guys read it, you will never forget, this is ""Hello World"". Little by little, it will help you in advanced method in C with definitions and tutorials. In my opinion, going through this book is more valuable than many university class. There is also references at the back of this book, you can find it helpful in some tutorial. Totally, it's hard to find a small (272 pages), clear and informative book like this one in many C programming language books."
626,5,book from Author - best book there is for C Programming,"  Book is from Author of C. There are no revisions but there is nothing really changed as much in C.Very good for anyone - beginner or expert.If you are planning to work on C then must buy.I have international version, us version (I don't know why two...but have to buy other when first one was not accessible). I also have Kindle edition...which I use the most now."
627,5,Buy it,  Must have for any programmers library
628,5,Should be on every professional's bookshelf,"  I've been programming in C (among other programming languages) for over 30 years now and it still amazes me that whenever I have some question about how C will handle some construction this book invariably will provide an answer.  The 2nd edition is a very worthy successor to the 1st and anyone who seriously programs in C should have this book on their shelf for reference.  The book does have a bit of a tutorial to help those who already program in some other procedural language and to provide a vehicle for examples, but the book is definitely not a good choice for a true beginner or someone who needs a lot of hand holding to get through a programming exercise.  I always like to contrast this book with the typical Java reference, which typically rivals War and Peace in size.  In a little over 200 pages, K&R manage to exhaustively cover C and its most commonly used libraries.  For those interested in writing a compiler, they also include the grammar.  The book is truly a tour de force in how much the authors have managed to cram into so few pages.  There is very little redundancy, which is why it is a frustrating book for first-timers.  Over the years I've acquired a number of C references and none come remotely close to this one for staying power; my other C references in truth are collecting dust, whereas I'm on my second copy of this one having worn out the first.As many of you know, C is the language created to develop Unix, which is why it retains its stature as a major programming language and why so much system software continues to be written in C or its derivative C++.  If you are a professional, or at least reasonably good in some procedural programming language, with an interest in getting up to speed in C, this book is probably your best bet.  It's no accident that C compiler writers talk about their compilers being ""white book C"" compliant (which is why the white cover has been retained).  K&R has long been the semantic standard for C, so if you want to be an expert, you should have a copy of this book to be able to get your knowledge of C from the horse's mouth."
629,5,An easy read.,"  This is a surprisingly easy to read book.  It's an oldie, but it's worth reading to understand C from the creator's perspective.  These days I mostly use C# and C++, but C is the base for a lot of the languages and systems in place today.  It's also good to know for embedded work.  Author doesn't try to be academic, overbearing or condescending, so it's a pretty good read.  It's very slim, but seems to cover everything one would need to know about C (it's not a big language to begin with)."
630,5,Great reference,"  I used this as a reference when learning C. Absolutely wonderful. Granted, there are some things in here people shouldn't be doing anymore as they're not socially acceptable (type-casting mallocs, for instance,) but it's still a great reference.What this book is not for, but people seem to propagate it for: this isn't for a person who has never programmed before or who has no idea about basic program constructs or programming concepts. It's really meant as an introduction to a language, not an introduction to programming."
631,3,but found the information so basic and no better than looking at the C documentation online,"  The text book is okay for beginners. I tried returning to this book throughout my programming career, but found the information so basic and no better than looking at the C documentation online."
632,5,"A nice, informative, and complete book about C.","  If you want to learn how to code in C, buy this book. It is a small but a very complete and informative book."
633,1,Terrible pricing policy,  Book rented USED for $43.92.  Purchase option $39.82?  NEW book price today $53.  No compromise.  Beware before renting
634,5,Not very detailed but a perfect reference.,  Well i am happy i bought this because this is the best general purpose programming language of all time in my opinion. I have a lot of c programming guids and books on the shelf however none are as portable and quick but good ref to the ANSI c standards.I just wish the quality of the paper was better also the font they used can sometimes hard to follow specially during the midnight. I really like this and i would buy it again if there is a better quality of print available.thanks you Dennis and Brian and all other guys whoever worked on this artwork.
635,5,Where to learn the fundamentals,"  There are a great many books on programming and the C variants in general.  The giant books, which are supposed to teach you everything, actually don't do a good job at anything.  I first bought the original text of this book (1st edition) in 1985.  I bought the paper version of the 2nd edition shortly after it was released.  Just recently I bought the digital version of the 2nd edition to keep it accessible.  My paper version finally is ready for the recycling skip.Anyone that programs modern systems and/or in mobile environments will benefit from this text.  Someone just trying to learn will find it indispensable because it grounds you in the fundamentals.  Subsequent platform and API specific texts will refine skills and knowledge but without a proper foundation, your code will always suffer.One of the most common problems I find in supposedly ""commerical grade"" software is a lack of fundamental technique."
636,5,Excellent C programming reference,"  The book came in excellent condition and I believe, arrived 5 days earlier than expected. The content of the book is a superb reference for the C programming language. For the price, this is a great investment for me. I highly recommend the book and I also recommend the seller."
637,5,A Timeless Classic,"  The crystallised definition of ""the original C language"" preserved in a useful form for admirers and practitioners alike.It begins with history and origin and proceeds into a tutorial and rather thorough delineation of the language, ending with a few appendices that make it a good reference on the standard(s), practices, conventions, lexical structures and standard routines for regular users and the curious."
638,5,It's a Classic.,"  What can you say, this is the classic. Sure it's a bit dated, but you've got to have it handy when you're programming in C. I purchased this for my son, who is taking a C programming class at school, but I still to refer to my copy (pre ANSI-C version) that I purchased in 1985."
639,4,Good book on the topics it covers,"  A bit dated and doesn't go into especially advanced concepts, but nevertheless a good technical book written by some of the most highly qualified people for the topic. The pacing is good, and the writing is clear and not overly dry."
640,4,"Very authoritative book, but some tech background needed","  Seeing as this is written by the guy who invented C, you cant go wrong when it comes to accuracy and information here. Overall, the book sets a good pace, and explains all the concepts quite well. However, there are some leaps in logic, and having the help of a somewhat ""easier"" book will help readers without a background in science/logic/math/whatever. Something along the lines of the ""for Dummies"" books would be an example. Even so, the chapters make sense, and everything is explained well, but good luck doing the sample problems based upon what you learned in the chapters without the aid of a secondary source."
641,5,Concise.,"  Great book.  I already had a basis in programming (with Java) when I started reading and referring to this book.  It's concise enough to make quick references but I feel it could be a good book for novice programmers, as well."
642,5,Must have for C programming,"  This is still the best book for learning C programming, and it's the book I used over twenty years ago when I was seeking to increase my mastery of the language.I purchased this copy so I could assist a junior colleague with working through the examples."
643,4,Great for folks with some programming experience already and the ...,  Hard book. Great for folks with some programming experience already and the patience and curiosity to dig deeper than usual.
644,5,Awesome,  Awesome book for c programming
645,5,"If learning C, this is the book to start with",  Excellent foundation work on C.  Would recommend it to anyone learning C
646,5,Perfect for intermediate programmers,"  Currently half way through this book. I've worked for about a year in front end web dev and python dev. If you have never programmed before, this book is not for you, as it assumes you know basic to intermediate programming strategies concepts and terminology. This is not a tutorial book on programming, it is a tutorial book on C. If you have experience programming in a higher level language and want a challenging language to learn, you'll love this book. Not only does it teach you C, but it indirectly helps you better understand data types and developing good program structure. It focuses almost 100% and string manipulation, which is good and bad, I wish there were other concepts, but either way this book is great. Huge reference in the back to stdlib functions as well as all the semantics of C, certainly a resource that I believe I will always make use of even after years of C programming. Worth the money. Awesome book!"
647,5,Timeless Classic!,"  Classic book! Highly recommend! Must read for any Computer Science student and those interested in a career in programming! The C language is the best language to learn if you are a beginner, and this text doesn’t disappoint!"
648,5,First book you have to read!!!,"  if your new to C ""C Programming Language"", is the first book you need to read and from there jump to other books. this book give you exactly what you need to understand the language and start using the advantages of C.We are not talking about a cooking guide the book will introduce you to the basics with examples and from there you have to use what you just learned and use it into your daily basis or personal projects."
649,5,The standard C reference,  The bible.  Every C programmer needs a copy near to hand.  Just how do you declare a static pointer to an array of functions returning a volatile structure pointer?
650,5,useful,  good book useful
651,5,Best book on C bar none.,"  This is the best book on C. These guys literally wrote the book on C. Actually, the book named ""The book on C"" was not good at all, I meant that these two guys are the original inventors of this stuff and they really explain it well."
652,5,"Indepth, advanced",  Helped me crack my interviews and get my first job
653,5,Clear concept,  We still use C in commercial product. This books gives me so much clear concept that I can relate almost all techniques in real work application. This book not only describe C language but also how to use the language. Some of the concept may be old fashion but old is gold. For me this book is gold.
654,5,Perfect,  Perfect book for those who are used to high level programming languages such as java or c# and want to learn where all came from and how those languages do their magic in the background.
655,3,Great way to brush up on C,  Give good information on C I would say it's more of an intermediate level book but still good for beginners
656,5,Best C book out there!,"  The quintessential ""first"" book you should buy if you are considering programming in C! Written by the men who created the language...it doesn't get any better than this!This is a rather small book compared to other programming language's books, but it's written in a concise, straight-forward style that honors the C language itself. Quit thinking about it....just order the book...it deserves a space on your book shelf."
657,5,Classic book,  It’s great to have this classic book from the creators of the C language.
658,5,good,  good
659,1,Do not buy this edition.  Extremely poor quality printing.,"  This is not a review of the book itself.  It's the review of publication quality.  This is the type of book you find in cheap bookstores in Asia and Americas.  The printing is literally blurry and hard to read.  Paper quality is subpar.  This a classic book, it deserves more respect.  I think that a bunch of hacks are peddling copies meant for black market on Amazon."
660,5,Five Stars,"  Everything you need to know about C, would suggest picking up the ""answers"" book that follows it."
661,5,"K&R, what more to say?","  This is K&R, what more can I say? If you want a good clear introduction to classic C, then this is the stuff. It is obviously an old book, written shortly following the release of C by the original authors (although this is the second edition from 1988), so don't expect modern stuff. But for an introductory book or for those interested in the history of C, this is essential."
662,5,"The C programming language is such a clean, condense ...","  The C programming language is such a clean, condense, and focused book on exactly what you want to learn: the C programming language. In the beginning of the book they even explicitly tell you how they aren't there to try and teach you the fluff, or writing clean code. The book is there to teach you about one of the most important languages of our modern world. This book is a must have for any developer who wants to take their personal advancement seriously. Even if you don't use C in your daily job or life, I personally believe you should still learn it and use this exact book because nobody can explain it more clearly than the creators of the language."
663,5,Not the best for beginners but they could use it too,  Best book I ever bought especially for a student very helpful full of ideas and examples although not the best for beginners but they could find this book rather easy to understand
664,5,"It's K&R, what more could you want?",  This *is* the C book.
665,5,The C Bible for College Classes,  Required for my Systems Programing Class at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Very important book that is written by the original creators of the C language! Any Computer Scientist or Softwear Engineer should have this book.
666,4,Four Stars,  excellent book to use in trying to learn C
667,5,The same famous K&R Book,"  This book really holds up well in the 21st century (writing this review in 2021.) The book is technical, but also accessible to beginners to the C language; a hard balance to strike."
668,5,A classic,  Timeless. A must read for any programmer
669,5,One of the best ways to learn C.,"  It doesn't matter how experimented of a programmer you are (counting the minimum as a brief knowledge of loops and conditionals as well as a little syntaxis), you can always take a look at this book and learn a little more. Some exercises are quite challenging for the novice programmer but they are achievable, and most of them help a lot. Despite its old age, it is still a very good source of learning good C programming and I highly recommend it if you want a deep understanding of the language."
670,5,Portable assembly is pretty accurate.,"  C89 is an extremely bare-bones language, which you can only really appreciate once you see how tiny this book is. Portable assembly is pretty accurate."
671,1,Horrible print quality,  All the text is very blurry. Horrible print quality.
672,5,Very good for anybody who is doing any type of C ...,  Very good for anybody who is doing any type of C programming. Teaches little details that most teachers leave out.
673,4,Doesn't get much more C than this!,  The C Bible
674,5,The Book,  This book is the book that books wish they could be. This book is the book of books. This book is... THE C BOOK.
675,5,This is probably the 5th time I've purchased this for ...,  This is probably the 5th time I've purchased this for other people to learn C. Classic. Clear. Must have for beginning C programmers.
676,5,Valued Resourse,  This is the goto reference for 'C'.  Kernighan & Ritchie are the authors (constructors) of the 'C' language itself....
677,5,Great book,  Perfect for anyone of any level interested in picking up the C language
678,5,Easy to learn for CS class,"  Very easy to learn from and complements my CS class great. Went from not knowing anything about C, to being proficient."
679,5,Good (best?) book,"  This is a really good book to learn C. The writing is concise, clear, and deep. The examples and problems are the best: K&R find a way to make both sets of programs actually useful rather than just throwaway programs about counting types of frogs or some such nonesense. If you want to teach yourself C, this is the book for you (though a little experience beforehand is nice: the book moves fast)."
680,1,Not needed,  C+ book not needed was not much of use
681,5,Real Coding,"  Only wish I had more time to play with learning how to code in C. The writing is excellent. It doesn't rush you through it, and it doesn't give a bunch of boring background information that you don't even need to know yet before it jumps into the coding samples."
682,1,Terrible printing quality,  You'll break your eyes reading it
683,5,The language that gave us Unix.,"  I still love this book, this is my third copy, 1st on Kindle. This book will give you the foundation we all should have started with. A little geeky, but hey it's C.Rich"
684,5,Five Stars,  The Reference. 'Nuff said.
685,4,Amazing C reference but not for beginners,"  Overall challenging little book, only problem is with the price. I recommend you pickup the answers book as well."
686,5,Read this book,"  If you program or are interested in programming, you should read this book. Even if you're working with a higher level language, the quality of this text warrants a read through."
687,5,I really enjoyed reading this book. It was well structured and I am going to take the examples from this book and learn this wonderful language.,  I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in programming. This programming language would be perfect for someone who is beginning their journey into software development.
688,5,Been studying computer science on my own for awhile now ...,  Been studying computer science on my own for awhile now and I have bought this book in the beginning of my adventure into this field. After getting some experience with programming I was able to finally crack the spine on this book and dive into it. You don't need a professor to explain the examples and the wording is simple.
689,5,Five Stars,  A must-have book for everyone.  This book should be in hotel rooms instead of the Gideon Bibles.
690,5,The Standard for learning C,"  There are over 200 hundred other reviews for this book. If that's not enough of a recommendation I don't know what is. This is the standard for learning C, it's through, yet simple, and covers all the bases needed to get into starting C. Even if you've been using C for years I'd still recommend having this on your shelf."
691,5,great seller,"  A little hard for one starting, so I recommend one great flash cards to help one study this  book."
692,5,It's quite possibly the best book written to describe a compiler language,  Someone gave me this book years ago. I lost it and purchased another. It's quite possibly the best book written to describe a compiler language.
693,4,Best Programming Book(so far...),"  I am a college grad student studying Information Security and we do some programming(mostly Java so far) but I wanted to begin learning C before I take classes that require it.  I purchased this book based on the past reviews and the fact that it is written by the father of C.  So far, I've read the first chapter and all I can say is that it is my favorite programming book I have ever read.  It starts out simple(assuming you have some programming background of some kind) and cleanly and easily describes the code and what it does/why it does something.  I know this is a short review but so far I'm addicted to this book(that never happens with a programming book) and I look forward to learning C. In short, pick this up if you want to learn C!"
694,5,A lot of it isn't relevant to using C today ...,"  A lot of it isn't relevant to using C today, but this WAS the original programming book. How can you say no to having such a big part of history in your hands. The original ""Hello World"" program is in this book."
695,5,Forget googling - but a book,  Old book is new again! Sometimes a book beats googling everything by far.
696,5,Five Stars,  The Bible of C programming.
697,5,The Bible,  Why don't you already own this book?  Buy it.
698,4,Four Stars,  Good reference
699,5,"... an introductory book on ""C"" and found this was recommended by a MIT professor who was teaching microcontroller courses","  I was looking for an introductory book on ""C"" and found this was recommended by a MIT professor who was teaching microcontroller courses.  So I bought it and found it to be clear, authoritative and easy to follow.  I would  recommended this to anyone wanting to start  ""C""."
700,5,Great book. Easy to follow,  Great book.  Easy to follow.  Good examples.
701,5,Essential,"  Even if you never intend to use C, learning C is like learning programming Latin. Every step you take to traverse the low-level fundamentals will pay off in spades as you move into more abstracted paradigms. Essential for all entry-level cs students, or anyone  for that matter who is brand new."
702,5,Great reference,  Great reference for school.
703,5,For a baseline understanding of C this is the holy ...,  For a baseline understanding of C this is the holy grail. Most of the time people code in Python or Ruby or something new and fancy. C is the language to use if you want to be close to the metal. This book changed the way I think about programming and even though I program in Python today I owe a debt of gratitude to this book for teaching me how to think about programming.
704,5,One stop shop for C,"  The best, can't beat the classics."
705,5,10 stars,"  I woud give this book 10 stars if possible. Everybody SHOULD read this book atleast once. If not to learn C, then to learn how to write a book about programming in a beautifully concise manner, or indeed review another. I keep going back to fully absorb all the little gems. As modern readers, we rarely find a book with so little waste. Read every single line. Its worth it.Note: While it is probably not a basic introduction to programming,  one doesn't need to be an intermediate or advanced programmer to read this book. Be prepared for a steep learning curve."
706,5,STILL A CLASSIC,  A standard reference....every programmer should have a copy.  Bought kindle version....still easy to use and I was able to register it to get my free download of program files.
707,5,The canonical text - perfect in every way :),"  Like a Mozart or Pink Floyd piece, this book is perfect. Nothing can be added or taken away without diminishing it."
708,5,Great book for any C family programmer,"  This book is a classic. It's good not only for those interested in C, but also for those working in a C-derived language (PHP, Ruby, Python, etc). All around a solid read, the section on pointers was stellar and probably the first time I ever truly understood how they worked."
709,5,Five Stars,  Quality of book is good as new. Same covered as classroom book. Very great price.
710,5,Concise and Comprehensive,"  When I received the book I was a little disappointed at its' diminutive size, but quickly found that it is incredibly detailed without being overly so.  Each section is clear about the topic it is trying to cover, and the lessons are reinforced by completing all the exercises.This is NOT a book to teach you about the standard library.  This is a book about how to program using C as your language of preference."
711,5,Well written,"  I've had programming experience before, but this book has really taught me a lot. I would recommend it as the standard for anyone who wants to begin learning C."
712,5,Great for Programmers,"  A great reference book, and a must read for any serious programmer"
713,5,A classic.,  This is really a great starting place for anyone interested in learning C. It deserves a place on every programmer's bookshelf.
714,5,Best C Book,  I started programming with micros a little while ago.  I started my programming life with C++ and as such there was some holes in my pure C ability to code.  This book help me not just understand the syntax but it gives a perspective and philosophy to help mold the way a programmer should attempt to solve the programming problems.  This has been one of the best programming books I have owned.  I would highly recommend it.
715,4,Well-written and organized but kind of dry to go through,"  This is a solid resource to learn C from. It's very well organized and quickly gets you through a lot of useful functions, loops, etc within the first few chapters, with plenty of exercises to work through. It's not a book for absolute beginners because it does assume you have some basic programming knowledge outside of C. In addition, you'll be on your own for finding a compiler and figuring out how to work with it, so Google is your best friend with that (I'm using Eclipse with the MinGW Compiler).My only complaint is that many examples in the book are not particularly interesting. Yes, they do test and improve your skills related to that section of the book, but they could have a more interesting/useful context. Some are painfully boring, like writing a program that counts blank spaces or tabs. I just think that starting the book out with more interesting applications would make it easier and more fun to go through. They should take a leaf out of CodeAcademy's book for their next edition."
716,5,good book for students,  Son likes it. Lots of info too
717,5,THE Instruction Book for C!,"  This update on the classic and Best book ever written teaching the C programming language has big shoes to fill, it does this hands down!  Having been a C programmer for 15 years before getting cancer, I did use this edition in the last years of my professional career.  In my previous job I instructed and mentored junior members of my team.  In that position I personally spent my own money to buy books to find the best books to teach junior members.  Out of 20 odd books I bought, read, & reviewed for my job - I felt K&R was the best.  The only drawback most junior members commented on was that the solutions to exercises were in another book that they had to purchase."
718,5,"I love the book, thank you!",  I love the book!
719,5,Great book to learn C,"  Great book to learn C, but a little difficult for learner from scratch"
720,5,"Still a classic, after all these years","  If you know how to program, and are interested in learning C, this is the book you should read. Even if you know C, it's worth a re-read every once in awhile."
721,5,Accurate Description,"  The book arrived right on time, and exactly in the quality it was advertised. Clearly used, but still in very good condition. The book moves through concepts very quickly, and is going to frustrate many beginners. For those who have programmed before and wish to learn C, the book is perfect for you. The book is extremely informative, and doesn't beat around the bush at all. The author gets straight to the point, and moves on. I am very satisfied with the buy."
722,1,Ce livre est vieu et d'une qualité misérable,"  J'ai reçu ce livre qui ne pouvait pas être exporté hors de pays exotiques comme l'Inde, le Sri Lanka et autre pays d'Asie. Qui plus est, il était tout abîmé.Depuis, j'ai été remboursé..."
723,5,Five Stars,  An excellent reference if you already know some C.
724,5,C as it could be.,"  Hello all:This book IS the C reference. Time and again I use to flip its pages, looking for basic concepts of C. Every C programmer msut have a copy of it in his library."
725,5,Five Stars,  Great reference for those who wish to learn C. Tried and true.
726,5,Five Stars,  Still an absolute classic.
727,5,Five Stars,  A much better book than the text book I was required to purchase for the class.
728,5,Five Stars,  Excellent referrence book. This book doesn't talk over your head like some text books do.
729,4,What to add that hasn't been said?,"  Like most technical programming literature, there is always a need to supplement, and as others will undoubtedly mention here and elsewhere, the K&R (as the book is called) is no exception to such supplementation, nor is it an 'easy beginners' book. The book is definitely designed to be a crash course into the C language, imposing some antiquated, dubious programming practices that may, if unknowingly followed religiously, may stick on the budding programmer. That said, the book is quick and relatively approachable. Personally, I managed to get through supplementing my reading with general online tutorials, the Stack Overflow database of questions, and The C Primer Plus (6th edition).It is outside of the scope of this review to point out all the 'bad' things that the K&R illustrates as acceptable, and it's more of the burden on the reader to explore as many technical books on best practices and heuristics to separate out the questionable practices from the definitely positive, strong ones. This said, the book is not a 'best practices' tome in the likes of Code Complete (McConnell). The book is designed to get readers to understanding (actively and passively) the inner workings of the C language. Side note: for most programming texts it is often better to march ahead and keep reading and examining when you don't understand what's going on; don't get held up trying to figure out a section of a section: instead, get to the end of the section and then struggle with wrapping your head around the concepts.tl;dr: The K&R is rightly a classic for it's 'crash course' approach, but it will not teach you the C language entirely on it's own. You will need to explore the ideas in more than one form (like most programming or mathematical concepts) in order to get a clearer, more succinct view, and although I do not doubt that there are many fantastic and direct technical books that do just this, the K&R is not one of them."
730,5,the best(?) book about C,"  Definitely a timeless classic.  The style is serious but accessible.  Every programmer should have C in their programming arsenal, whether they use it frequently or not.  It's sort of the Latin of computer languages, except that people still program in it (a lot).  The copy I received was the Asian (Indian, Pakistan, Sri Lanka etc) edition, which is identical to the US version except for some extra language on the title page.  Get this book, read it, and learn it!  There's also a widely available book with answers to all the programming exercises (I've never seen that book, so I can't say anything about it).  Definitely 5 stars.C rocks!"
731,5,Duh.,"  A must have.Could use some syntactic updating to c99.But the stuff within is still pure, even entertaining and nostalgic in the way it is dated."
732,5,Essential,  This book is essential for any C-derived language.
733,5,Five Stars,  Fantastic book for learning C. A recommend buy
734,5,Good compact reference book,  I used to dislike C but then I hadn't read this book. It's a good compact reference book. Nice addition to my library.
735,5,A timeless classic,  One of the greats
736,3,"Great reference, but not for beginners","  As the title says, it is a great reference.  You can certainly read through this book, work the examples, and have a cursory understanding of how C works.  Do that, and you'll be able to read code, understand basically what it does, etc.  But you'll have no clue how to write a new program.  This book will break down each individual command, and never put them together in a big picture kind of way.  Essentially, it is like this book teaches you individual words, but not how to make a sentence.For any beginners out there that need not only the basics, but also some tips for real-world application, and how to conceptually write programs, etc, I recommend you check out Wibit.net  Their video tutorials are exceptional, and will baby-step you through the process of getting started.  I personally started with this book, and was still semi-lost and close to where I started after reading it.  The guys at Wibit.net will teach you the basics, as well as the why and how of what you're doing, so you can actually write programs.  THEN, you can go back and refer to this book... that is it's real utility."
737,5,C Programming Language Answer Book,"  Should be used in conjunction with The C Programming Language, 2 ed book."
738,5,Great book to learn C,  The C book from the father of C. I found the examples to be clear and easy to follow I would recommend this book to anyone interested in C that is already knowledgeable in computer science principles.
739,5,Helpful book,  Bought it for my Systems Programming class.
740,5,Five Stars,"  Great book covering the basics of C, written by the people who created it."
741,5,What can I possibly add to all the other comments ...,  What can I possibly add to all the other comments. Some books are a classic. This is a classic classic.
742,4,Don't be a copyright year snob. It's still relevent.,"  I bought this book to refresh my memory of C before I moved on to Data Structures. Several reviews called it a decent reference book so I picked it up. I'm so use to internet reference sites that I was initially disappointed that it didn't just beam the info back into my brain, but when I thought I had completely forgotten pointers it saved the day. It turned out I hadn't gotten used to a new compiler's hotkeys and my brain wasn't melting. Anyway, it seems to be a decently thorough reference after all."
743,5,A Great Book for Intermediate and Above Programmers,"  This book does not hold your hand which, as a programmer with plenty of experience, I feel that I am learning more without the book holding my hand."
744,5,The book to get,"  What can really be said about this book other than ""Get It""if you are trying to learn C this is the go to book."
745,5,Great book to get started with c,"  I've been using this book on and off for an entire semester now.  This book is a great reference to get exposed to all the basic constructs and functionality of the C language.  Sometimes the author's code examples are a bit esoteric, but can be deciphered with some effort.  Overall I would recommend this book as supplementary reading to anyone that is learning the C programming language.  It also seems like it would be a quick, handy reference for those who may not use the language day to day."
746,5,Recommended,"  Just enough book for the topic - no door stopper, but a great enabler instead.Even tho we got all these wonderful languages, knowing C is still a quasi necessity when you run into edge cases that require hand tuned code, especially in the age of ""mobile"" devices."
747,5,Five Stars,  Must-have for CS folks.
748,5,Five Stars,  Its a great book and will always be relevant!
749,4,Four Stars,"  Useful, but kind of basic."
750,5,A model programming book,"  Previously having a fair grasp of C++, I thought I should briefly take a look at programming in pure C. This book covered every concept very concisely, and I feel much more competent C after reading it. This is a model of technical communication, and should be read by every programmer."
751,5,Also nice to have a piece of history the guys who ...,  Priceless reference for C class I am taking.  Also nice to have a piece of history the guys who started it all.
752,5,The Must-have,"  I've read the first edition, and this is a must.  It doesn't cover some of the details of ISO/ansi 99, but those can be found elsewhere.  What can't be found is the way the authors drag even the beginning student right into the depths of memory allocation so soon.  This book isn't too easy, but it's one no student of c can be without, and it's well-written, into the bargain."
753,5,Five Stars,  Fantastic - it can't be beat!
754,3,Very good quality product,  I didn't like how they didn't have the practice questions in the book.
755,5,The definitive C Programming Book,"  This book is still popular years after it was published due to the fact that it is concise, readable, and relevant. Anyone looking to learn C programming should start with this book, it may be the only one you need."
756,5,5 stars!!!,  How this masterpiece can be rated less??)))
757,5,Five Stars,  Book was in great shape.
758,5,The Book on C,"  This is the book to have on the C language. A great reference and a great read. This book has been very influential in the field of technical books, often imitated. I recommend it to beginners to advanced programmers."
759,5,Five Stars,  good review of C language.  Not cluttered with object programming
760,5,The one and only,  The one and only C book you will need.
761,5,A programmer's bookshelf requirement,  A must have. A classic
762,5,Five Stars,  My professor says as I step into industry I will see this on every programmers shelf
763,5,Learning C,"  This is the perfect book for anyone wishing to learn C. Written by he creators of C, it covers all the features of the language systematically with many examples and programming exercises. This book is well organized and succinct enabling it to function as a good reference manual for the C programming language."
764,5,Five Stars,  use it almost every month at my jobstill relevant
765,4,"Great Reference, Just Not For Beginners...","  It's a really nice resource to have. Being written by the guys who designed C is also great. However, I would not recommend this as a book to start programming. The book is technical and does expect the reader to have some knowledge of programming and computer architecture. If you are looking for a good place to start programming, Java may be a better place to start, as it is a higher level language with more strict requirements. The problem with C is that, if you are not sure about what you are doing, you may create some kind of error, but the program will still run. Java compilers are much pickier about how code is written, which is actually very good for a beginner as they will learn proper techniques of coding."
766,5,if you want a C book written by the author ...,"  if you want a C book written by the author of the C language and Unix, this is it."
767,5,Five Stars,  Thank you :)
768,5,Five Stars,  classic
769,5,This is how I taught myself to program in high ...,  This is how I taught myself to program in high school. A lot of nostalgia when I see it on my bookshelf.
770,5,A great place to start.,"  Anyone that's ever touched a programming language that wants to learn C should start here.  Especially all of you recent additions to the UNIX/Linux world -- buy it now, pass it on to someone else later."
771,5,I agree with Dr.Dobbs,  Dr.Dobbs rates this as a premier example of how a text book should be written.  After working thru the first several examples I agree////////.
772,5,Five Stars,  Really seems to help in my programming class.
773,5,The Classic... and still the best..!!!,"  Concise ..and to the point explanation of the C programming language.K and R explain the language syntax and semantics in a succinct manner, that makes the reader understand C in record time.This book serves as an invaluable reference on my bookshelf."
774,5,Answered all my questions about the C language,  It answered MANY questions I had with the C language. I recommend it to anyone who wants to really understand all the details of the language.
775,5,This is the closer,"  This is the droid you are looking for.  But seriously the cheap $15 version is international which is fine for me.  But this is the book you are looking for, if you are decent at math and can boot up CodeBlocks this book will be your baby and take you everywhere you want to go in C from Hello world to infinity and beyond.  Great to read by itself and understand or follow along on codeblocks."
776,4,Not all it's cracked up to be,"  This isn't that good of a book. Some of the examples have security-related bugs in them. I am not sure why this book is recommended by so many people - it might have been a great way to learn C a few years ago, but in 2014 there are better, more accessible resources.Also note that the upcoming gcc 5.0 release uses C11 by default, which is not covered in this book."
777,5,Seminal work,  A seminal work.  As a professional programmer who learned C++ first in university I used this as a resource to dig deeper into C and used it as a focus for a book club at work.  I think anyone who plans to learn/use C should get a copy of this book.
778,4,Excellent reference; terrible learning resource,"  This book is probably the best reference book for C.  However, do not bother trying to learn C from this book unless you are pretty comfortable with programming.  For learning C, there are better resources out there."
779,5,it's a great read that shows a lot of intention behind the ...,"  Even though this doesn't cover C99, it's a great read that shows a lot of intention behind the creation of certain C features."
780,5,Start Here,"  Kernighan and Ritchie present the C Programming Language to the learner in a most direct way.  As a result, nearly every word in every sentence counts.  No effort is made to present the material in one particular learning style over another.  The material is described succinctly but also with great thoroughness.  The beauty of the book is discovered when the reader comes to understand that what is here somehow suffices.That said, this $#!+ is not easy.  For an inexperienced programmer, or someone who is just starting out, a more forgiving supplementary C Programming Language text is more or less required.  I used Practical C Programming by Steve Oualline, which has end-of-chapter exercises that offer some amount of hand holding, something you won't find in the excellent exercises here.The book is not perfect, but I wouldn't argue with someone who claimed it was.  Buy it, and then continue to read it over and over again until the material gradually shifts from the intimidating to the comfortable."
781,5,This is exactly the book I've been looking for. ...,  This is exactly the book I've been looking for. I've owned a couple of copies of this book over the past decades and there is stuff in this book that has been deleted from the newer ones.
782,5,Excellent Book,"  I have been programming for a little while now (mostly web development, javascript, php, and ruby) and this is my first book I've read on C and it was great. It doesn't just show you how to write in C but it also explains a lot about programing in general, if you read it that way. Definitely a book every programmer should pick up."
783,4,good book to learn c,  old but good
784,5,Thank you.,  Thank you.
785,5,Five Stars,  Just as expected !
786,5,The required read for any C programmer,"  Whatever reason one finds to dislike this book, this is a book you must read, at least once. Any book written by the creator gives you a unique view of the language. No other book will give you this insight, no matter how good the book author is.I read this book 15 years ago, but only after I've graduate in CS I was able to grasp all the details, mainly the grammar. The authors condense a lot of knowledge in one sentence.Newbie programmers may find this book a bit dense, and it is definitively not the easiest place to start learning the language. However, sooner or later you will have to read this book to consider yourself a truly C programmer."
787,4,Great Reference Book,  I purchased this book for a undergrad class in 2005 and I still have the book today. The book is clearly written and easy to follow.
788,5,Five Stars,  Great product
789,4,Four Stars,  Easy to follow. great guide
790,5,Great book.,"  Complete, yet concise, excellent index.Early on, the book patiently teaches you the language with examples, then, toward the end of the book, it describes the language concisely and precisely for the pro."
791,5,Great Tutorial For Learning And Mastering C,"  The C Programming Language is a fantastically written book on learning the C programming language. On the back cover of the book the authors state that ""C is not a big language, and it is not well served by a big book."" While relatively short, the book packs a ton of information with most sentences containing direct and clear language.Beginning chapters focus on what you would expect, such as variables, the type system, control statements, and functions. Most aspects of the language get 2-4 pages of description.I found there to be a huge jump in difficulty for me starting in chapter five which was about pointers. I read the book fully through and initially thought chapter five was unnecessarily confusing. Later I went back and re-read the chapter and realized the explanations were good, but they require work and thought. This is not a book for skimming through. There are also exercises included at the end of many sections for those looking to master C.The authors assume you are already a programmer as there are comparisons to Fortran and Pascal sometimes. Examples in the book were relevant to common tasks a programmer might need. I appreciated there was an example of UNIX's grep, shown to be implemented in C.While the book was published in 1988, it still reads well. For those unfamiliar with C, the language itself has not changed that much the publication of the book. Although there a quite a few references to practices before ANSI C."
792,5,Best book for c,  You should read if you want to go C/C++
793,5,Five Stars,  very informative
794,5,Five Stars,  This book is a classic for any computer scientist.
795,5,good,  i love this product its great quality and very worth the money .I hope to buy more of them thx
796,5,Five Stars,  A classic.
797,5,one of those timeless classics,  This is the original career builder.
798,5,This book is very clear and easy to use as a quick reference,  I use this book more than my C textbook. This book is very clear and easy to use as a quick reference.It is in my honest opinion that this is the book that anyone who is programming in basic C should keep on their desk.
799,5,Five Stars,  Dry but good!
800,4,C k&R,  The original C programming language book 2nd Edition by the fathers of the language.Item was exactly as i expected. This copy was a library reject that had never been borrowed.I was a bit disappointed with the price. But this popular title was printed over 20 years ago & is a must have for any programmer.
801,5,Five Stars,  the first book on C ... worth having !
802,5,Five Stars,  Really helpful.
803,5,Five Stars,  One of the best C books ever!
804,5,Five Stars,"  Just as described, quick ship!"
805,5,Excellent reference text,"  What more is there to say?  As others have said, this is THE reference text for anyone who uses C.  I use C fairly infrequently, but I still keep this within easy reach on my shelf."
806,4,Nice original book to understand and program in C,  Nice original book to understand and program in C. Suggest to anyone who is interested in programming in C.this book would be perfect if the Authors added examples an problems to it.
807,4,Four Stars,  The classic for C
808,5,Rich Information,  Good quality and very rich information on C
809,5,Great Book for Programming Essentials,  This is a great book for those looking for a strong foundation in the basics.  I bought this book to replace one I lent a friend
810,5,Absolute Necessity,  I used it regularly to support some legacy software.  This has got to be one of the best books on C programming I have ever found.
811,5,The ultimate representation of C,"  K&R is easily the best written and most authoritative book on the C language. Every level programmer should have this on their bookshelf whether you're beginner, intermediate, or advanced. However, I would not recommend this for learning C if C is your first programming language. This can be used to learn more about C and as a reference."
812,5,top of the line,  I'd say this is the book to own if you want to start working with c.  It may be a bit outdated at this time but it's still useful and to the point.
813,4,Four Stars,  nice writing
814,2,Garbage print quality,"  Garbage print quality. Was expecting aligned and clear text, minimum out of a book that isn't free. The content is not in question."
815,5,Great value learning and reference book for C,"  A great reference and learning book for an affordable price. Even in the modern world of google and stack overflow, this book (written by one of the authors of the C language).I used this book numerous times throughout college and learned quite a few tricks in C from it."
816,5,"Concise, factually dense","  I have had experience in x86 and PIC assembler, pascal, ADA, BASIC, and I wanted to play and contribute in the OSS world.I have found this to be a detailed, very readable book for getting up to speed with C for those with some programming experience.It is also shedding light on the utility of C in *nix generally for me.Concise, information packed, this somewhat seminal K&R ANSI C textbook lived up to my expectations.The GCC handbook also available from Amazon is a neat little book if anyone is struggling to get up and running with their compiler toolchain."
817,5,Five Stars,  Book was brand new
818,5,Probably the best reference out there for any programming language.,"  This thing introduces new concepts left and right and throws you right into the language. It's absolutely great for people who want to learn the language without any of the frills or proprietary, tunnelvision learning offered by books that try to teach you enterprise programming or other specific fields. Get this if you want to learn how to write C, not how to make programs in C."
819,5,awesome,"  Fast shipping, awesome book"
820,5,Fantastic book and superb service by seller,"  Fantastic book and superb service by seller: description of product was honest and accurate, and dispatch was prompt. Entire experience was first-class."
821,5,Best C Book in the World,"  Starts you off at the beginning and walks you through logically and simply. Best C book in the universe. If you want to learn C, start with this one."
822,5,Could use better print,"  As expected, the book was an excellent read. Everyone who deals with C-like languages should read this book if they haven't. Unfortunately however, the print quality could be better. The book looks like it's a scanned copy. The text is still legible but could be sharper. Paper quality isn't poor but isn't textbook quality (which is somewhat expected).Overall, the book is great but the publisher needs to do a better job or printing it."
823,5,Five Stars,  Uma obra indispensável e seminal.
824,5,A Must have for all C Programmers,  I've been writing professional C code for over 3 years and coding in C for much longer and I think this is a must have for all C programmers. Love the writing style... love the mode of teaching... everything.
825,5,Classic book doesn't disappoint,  I decided that I wanted to get more into computers & bought this book to help me do that. K&R walked me through C in a very concise but thorough way. When I get stuck there's plenty of help to be found online. I can strongly recommend this book for someone with a similar story to mine.
826,5,Computer programming,"  Husband recently began programming again in ""C"". Something that he hasn't done in years.He bought several recommended books (this one and C the 8051) to help ease back intosomething he had forgot more than he remembered. These books have been very helpful andmade the tasks less painful for him after all these years."
827,5,Good read,  Great book!
828,5,As wonderful as it was in 1988,"  C is still actual, or even more actual than before.And this C&R classic book still tops all lists on learning the language.Always wanted to have one in paper."
829,5,a great book to have,"  I still love this book,  a great reference to have"
830,5,Five Stars,  Great book!
831,5,Five Stars,  Five stars for the invaluable knowledge from the book.One star for the manufacturer.This book is not for novice. It's for those who already have knowledge about programming. I ended up with making some java games.. Know nothing about C. It's very very very helpful for me.
832,5,This is the C book to buy.,  Thoroughly detailed without being overly complicated or complex. One of the best books on programming languages that I have ever read. It's comprehensive without being dull or dry.
833,5,Five Stars,  Great book.
834,4,The definitive guide to C,  Great introduction to a very complex language.
835,5,Awesome if you're looking for a nice intro to C,"  Great book, anyone who wants to learn C should get this book. There are books that go into way more depth but this is an essential for anyone who wants to learn C, or anyone who works with C to use as a reference."
836,5,Very clear and simplifying book. Pleasantly cover the fundamentals of C and functional programming.,  Very clear and simplifying book. Pleasantly cover the fundamentals of C and functional programming. Highly recommended for new entrants of computer science.
837,5,The classic primer,"  It's thinner than most of the computer language books I have, but it does the job."
838,5,Five Stars,  Concise.
839,5,Five Stars,  THE book for C. Concise and without filler.
840,5,Five Stars,  Awesome book. Glad I bought it.
841,5,"From programmers, to programmers","  Well written book from fathers of C programming language. Book is not bulky, but it provides all important information, examples and excercises."
842,5,C Programmin Languge,"  This book is great and very useful. However, it doesn't fit for someone who never know about programming. Generally, the quality of the sellers is 5 stars."
843,1,Wrong Book,"  I did not receive the desired book, instead I received the solution manual. Disgraceful !!"
844,5,Five Stars,  Great little book.  Actually bought it to replace a copy of it that I had years ago.
845,5,"Its made by the creator, what else can i say?","  Great book for anyone who wants to learn C programming, not bad if you also want to learn Objective C after learning this as it relies heavily on the C language."
846,5,Still the clearest description of the C programming language.,"  Best description of the C programming language by the founding author, updated from the original publication to include the ANSI coding standards. Clearest description of pointers, pointer to structure, and pointer to function of all the C language books I've read. Example problems are relevant and clearly described."
847,5,Five Stars,  Cannon.
848,5,Great help from the people who wrote the language!,  This is the book when it comes to knowing C. It's well written and an invaluable tool for anyone learning or using C.
849,5,Five Stars,  Great book!
850,5,Good book,  this is almost a must-have book for interviews if you are in the CSE domain -tags: computers textbookinterview
851,5,Great!,  The book was shipped fast and in perfect condition!  It is a great resource for learning the C language since it is written by the creator of C.  It is exactly what I wanted.  Thanks!
852,5,Five Stars,"  Best book to learn the language. Every programmer should have, whether or not you are a C programmer."
853,5,... book just to put on my bookshelf to look cool. It fulfills that function very well,  I bought this book just to put on my bookshelf to look cool. It fulfills that function very well. I look at it often.
854,3,C book is OK but not the best,  I didn't like this book as much as some others.  It's not as complete or concisely written as I would like.  It's not a bad book and is OK for someone who knows how to program and is wanting to start in C.
855,5,Five Stars,  good
856,5,Good book.,  Helpful in understanding C. I had to learn C for one of my classes and this was a good aid. One of my professors highly recommended this book since the authors worked at Bell Labs and helped to develop the language.
857,5,Five Stars,  Classic is classic
858,5,C Master,  This book is awesome in providing a great overview of the C language. Very detailed.
859,5,Five Stars,  Ok
860,5,"Great seller, great book",  Bought this book for a class.  It arrived earlier than expected and in better condition.  The book itself is also a very helpful reference guide for ANSI C.
861,3,Not what I expected,"  I was suprised to find this book is written to teach C programming but does not explain in depth the meaning of all the terms it just throws at you one behind the other. I wanted to see behind the scenes so to speak how such things as variable actually work at the hardware level. For me it makes learning a much greater challenge.However I am glad to own this book, because it covers the subject from start to finish. It makes a good reference book."
862,5,Five Stars,  Good book
863,5,Five Stars,  One of the best books for c language
864,5,Excellent book! A must read to really understand the ...,  Excellent book!A must read to really understand the C language!
865,5,Five Stars,"  Awesome, of course."
866,5,Five Stars,"  It,s all right"
867,5,The standard,"  This was written by the authors of the C language, what else needs to be said. It's complete without being overwhelming."
868,5,content and example is so good.,"  Writer known everything in C programming very well , content and example is so good."
869,5,A classic reference...,  I've used this reference for years and it's always been useful to come back to.  I have it in hard copy and it's nice to have it on my kindle.
870,5,Five Stars,  Great book! A little outdated but great
871,5,good book for C beginners,"  This book is recommended by my prof, a book that can be put on the bookshelf for a CS person."
872,5,Five Stars,  Essential
873,5,Great book a classic,"  Anyone who programs in C needs to have this book in their library.  The tutorial section is absolutely wonderful, not to mention all of the reference material.  The book is quite thin, but it is also very concise making it incredibly valuable to any C programmer."
874,5,Classic,"  Still relevant after all these years.  Highly recommended as a core reference for C, C++ and oop in general.Just make sure you don't lose it like I did!"
875,5,"Love the book, and it arrived when it should have","  This is like the bible of C, and makes for the best of resources to re-reference after learning - comes highly recommended for a beginner or an advanced referencer."
876,4,This book _is_ C,"  Please, if you're going to claim to know and program C, get this at least as a reference.  It _is_, after all, the standard.Once you have it for reference, go ahead and read it...there are some great insights in there.Argue with K&R stylistic choices if you want.  Complain that your hand's not held through setting up DevStudio or whatever overcomplicated mess you think of as ""C"" because you don't really grok the language.  Heck, even whine a little bit about the comment characters because you really don't know that C++ isn't just an updated version of C.But _do not_ argue that this book is not a must have for C programmers.  It is."
877,5,Five Stars,  I love programming in C/C++.
878,5,interesting,  This book will definitely help you familiar yourself with the C language if you have not taken any programming classes.
879,5,Five Stars,  Nice book
880,5,Classic,"  Read it if you have to do anything ever in C, C++. A must have for CS students. Concise and to the point. Every word matters, the authors don't BS around."
881,5,Very compact but authoritative.,"  Very compact but authoritative.Problem with C string debugging solved after reading this book.I didn't know that in C, character is also a 8-bit integer."
882,5,The Classic,  This is the 2nd edition of the Classic C Programming book.  Solid and timeless!
883,4,Objetivada ao tratar do assunto.,"  Recomendo, satisfez minhas expectativas, alias foi escrito pelos papas no assunto, Linguagem de programação C.Embora muito objetivo trata do assunto e não está preocupado com a didática."
884,5,THE canonical text regarding the C programming language. Succinct ...,"  THE canonical text regarding the C programming language. Succinct, to the point, doesn't dive off into much higher-level architecture or wizardry, but really gets you a core understanding of C itself. Reading this is isolation is not enough to become a wizard, of course, but this is one of many flagstones that pave the way to a foundation in modern computing."
885,5,Five Stars,  this was clean and like new
886,5,Wow!! Just Wow,"  The product is the greatest thing for C Programming there is. But I have to say BAM!! WOW!!! The product was hand delivered to my home by the seller, who turns out lives ~1 mile from my home. I couldn't be more satisfied with any online order I've ever placed before. Dude dropped it off the next day. I will seek out this guy for more book purchases in the future."
887,5,So good and shipping fast!,"  I love it and very good looks like new one. I love it, love it, love it so much, thank you!"
888,5,The most complete ANSII C description through REALLY boring in places as they use repetitiveness to make it ...,  The most complete ANSII C description through REALLY boring in places as they use repetitiveness to make it soak in.
889,5,Simply the most important book in the history of computer programming.,  Some things never change. The K&R is still the only book a person needs to read in order to fully understand computer programming.
890,1,It's a fake book,"  It's a fake book! Very low quality of printing. e.g. on the second page of the book (where all the copyright info locates), the text is blurred with excessive ink. The same thing happens all through the book. Also, the text in the book is not parallel to the edges. I guess that's why the book is so cheap."
891,3,"Excellent text, terrible binding.","  I've had the book for about two months; its been a truly excellent read, but pages have been starting to detach out since the first week. With so many excellent resources online, I tend to buy books solely because I like a solid physical reference... A poor binding defeats that purpose."
892,4,Good book if you don't know C,  This is probably one of the most helpful C books I have come across. I recommend it for anyone learning C or wanting to get better at it
893,3,Replacing the 'old faithful standard'.,"  The content of the book is very well done.  No doubt about that.I purchased this to replace my original copy which had been lost over the years.  (I've been developing with C since 1983.)The extra content is nice to have.If I have a complaint it's that the printing quality suffered.  It appears the printer did not properly take recycled paper into consideration when deciding which ink to use.  Print quality suffers as a result.Otherwise, it's good to have it back in my library.  It's been a while since I needed to use some of C's exotic features but I was quickly able to find the reference and syntax in the book..This is definitely one of those reference books to keep handly on the shelf but in front of your other exotic language references (Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL, APL, etc) haha"
894,5,Five Stars,  A good way to know the origin of C language.
895,5,Five Stars,"  Just as happy as I was with Volume 1, of the original!!!"
896,5,The MUST read book in IT,  I think the title and K&R are enough to say for this book.....//one two three four five words required
897,5,This book is a must have if you plan on ...,  This book is a must have if you plan on having a basic understanding of C. Definitely worth the buy.
898,5,Just what I was looking for.,"  This is THE book for learning the C language. While many people may feel C is out of date, it still accounts for about 16% of new code written. With the advent of Linux, C has been given new life. Plus, so many things are written in C and based on it, you have a leg up if you know C to start with."
899,5,Muy Bueno!,"  My professors and friends all recommend this book, and with good reason."
900,5,Five Stars,  I will use this for my studies
901,5,Five Stars,  It's not a best-seller for nothing
902,5,This is a Nerd classic,  I gave this to an up and coming computer genius.  Look out world in 4 years he will be hitting the IT market.  This book is a classic.  All serious hardcore CS people should have a Paper copy of this book.
903,5,Easy read,  Simple Easy to read format.
904,5,The seminal work on programming language. This is as ...,"  The seminal work on programming language. This is as if there were an official educational text on Latin. C is the basis of all programming languages. If you're going to write code, it's just not negotiable: you HAVE TO read this book."
905,2,Two Stars,  Useful but i still hate C
906,5,Five Stars,  Good product
907,5,Good book,  Well written. Just as long as it needs to be. I still reference this once in a while.
908,5,Five Stars,  Good book.
909,5,Thanks,  Thanks
910,5,No Surprises here!,"  The Classics proved again to be working fiiiiiineee!This book is a must if you want to understand the C programming language, C++ or Java."
911,5,yo!,  Gr8 book yo
912,5,"Pristine copy for a great price, thank you","  I bought a used copy from nutshell retails listed ""like new.""  There was but a single smudge in chapter two and other than that—perfect!  Pristine copy for a great price, thank you!"
913,4,NOT for beginners,"  I read and heard all the hype about this book and I had to check it out.  I ordered the book and started reading the first few pages and even got the famous ""hello, world!"" to print on my screen!  After that, the whole terminologies and technical aspect of programming in C went right over my head.  I put the book aside.I purchased another book called Absolute Beginner's Guide to C by Greg Perry which really was simple and easy to understanding C.  I then went back to this Kernighan/Ritchie book and it started to make a little more sense.  Again, however, as I started to read more of this book things are still too technical and goes right over my head.  Hopefully one day I'll be able to pick up this book and REALLY understand it.Update 7/22/2012: After several years of programming (PHP, Javascript, Visual Basic, BASH, Python, Perl, Powershell, C/C++), this K&R book is a nice reference book to have.  I still stand by my original review that it is NOT a book for beginners getting into programming."
914,5,A Classic for the Ages,  Still serves as an excellent reference text for ANSI-C while imparting gems of programming wisdom into those still learning.It was the first and remains the best.
915,5,If you get to know this little book you'll know C,"  I first bought this book over 15 years ago and ""loaned"" it to a friend in collage.I never forgave him for not returning it.Anyway, this is the best book on C that there ever was.  I wish they had it available in electronic format."
916,3,"Classic book, Bad Int'l Edition","  The content of the book is fantastic; classic computer science literature.  But a word of warning:  there is one listing on Amazon for the US edition, and another for an ""Eastern Economy Edition"".  I didn't look closely enough at the cover picture to notice the difference, and mistakenly bought the latter.  This is one of the few international edition books I've been disappointed with--the paper is very low quality, and I'm always afraid I'm going to break the binding if I open it too far.  To be fair, I got the book *very* cheap (which is why I jumped on it), but pay attention and know what you're getting."
917,5,Must have handbook for those who diving into system programming,"  This book is for1. System programmers/sysadmins2. Embedded developers3. Those who generally interesting in the OS architecture, structure and others"
918,5,Glad to find it and at a reasonable price to ...,  A classic !  Glad to find it and at a reasonable price to boot!
919,4,the only problem is the paper and print quality,"  the book is very good written, but why so good written book use so bad paper and the printing is really blur!!!!give five star to the book, give one star to the print and papper"
920,5,Best book for learning C,"  Even if you already know the language, it is the best book to get reference on a specific subjet. Great."
921,5,As advertised. Arrived in very good condition.,  Very good book on the C language which puts C in prospective relative to other well known languages.  Covers everything.
922,5,Best C programming book ever,  Best C programming book ever! I'd read a few other C programming book before. None of them was better than this book.
923,5,I love it,  I'm computer science student and I need to know C language for making Games. This book help a lot to learn C language.
924,5,Five Stars,  Classic book! The only one C programming book you must own.
925,5,Clear and concise,  Clear and concise instruction on the ANSI C language.
926,3,These guys should stick to writing programming languages,"  This review is in no way a reflection of the service which I have received from Amazon, which to date has been stellar!!! Great Job guys at Amazon!!!About the Book:I am a Physics Graduate and currently persuing my Masters in computer science. I bought this because I was in the process of learning C and wanted to understand the intricacies of the language from the perspectives of its creators. Well, to no avail.This book is not for a beginner of the language, and if you are a beginner ignore the excercises until you have read the whole book, or simply buy""The C Answer Book"", which is the one they probably really want us to buy.For ambitious programmers the book will be a good challenge. If you get through all the questions you should be able to create a simple compiler at the end of the book.Things that could be improved:1. Better explanations on how the language works with hardware2. Better demonstrations on how each command/ reserved word can be used,  especially the rand() function generator.I have also started reading one of Ivor Horton's books on C++, he is a fantastic teacher. I think if you are a beginner of any language, or simply want to know how a language really works check out any of his texts."
927,5,Five Stars,  Good Book
928,4,"Good, cheap alternative","  This book is a good alternative to the original, authorized version and a lot cheaper.  This book is only supposed to be sold in India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.  But if you're okay with that and the ugly green cover, you may as well get this book.  The binding and printing are good."
929,4,still great book and I would highly reccommend it,"  Smelled badly of cigarette smoke, still great book and I would highly reccommend it!"
930,5,Five Stars,  A must have in your collection.
931,3,learning C,"  I'm still new to C programing and have all ready  made use of it! Especially data types , operators and expressions"

It uses weird terms that is no longer used in the world of C and much of the programs won't work on modern systems with out finding work arounds such as finding a key combination for EOF.

940,5,Five Stars,  Excelent
941,5,Five Stars,  very nice book!
942,3,Lucky Find ...,  The stuff designed thirty five years ago was intended to last longer than just until the next model.  My old 1979 Heathkit computer is still running and expanding.  This is a tool needed to get the job done.

944,3,but I feel a little disappointed..,"  I thought it would be detailed and thorough, but I feel a little disappointed...And the book itself is not quite in good condition."
945,5,old friend,  I have used this book before so I knew it was good.  It has been a few years since I needed it and I was upset to discover I had lost it.
946,5,"Amazon made the entire transaction easy, fun","  The book, The C Programmng Language, 2nd edition, is exactly what I wanted, needed, and expected. Amazon made the entire transaction easy, fun, and painless. I will buy more books thru Amazon in the future.Tom Johnson, Clearwater, FL"
947,5,Five Stars,  This is a classic. Every real programmer should own this book.
948,5,Five Stars,  As promised
949,3,"The book content itself is great, but the 15th edition reprinting was totally a ...","  The book content itself is great, but the 15th edition reprinting was totally a shoddy job.  There are several discontinuous stacks of different colored paper that comprise the pages bound in this book.  The paper is not only obviously a different color, but of a different weight making it hard to flip through the book to find a place.  I bought it new to have a pristine copy, might have been better with an older ""like new"" copy."
950,3,Kinda Weird...,"  Print quality is crap.  Looks like it was photocopied in a hurry.Also, is ""Programing"" misspelled on the cover of anyone else's copy?"
951,3,I'm sure it was just a misteak...,"  The book arrived promptly, and I put it away for a few days.  Then, when I looked at it, I saw that about 40 of the pages at the end of the book were printed upside-down.  Very weird.  Did I get a counterfeit?  Was this a binding defect?  In any event, I contacted Amazon and they made it very easy for me to return the book with no shipping charges and gave me credit for the everything I paid for the book.  I'll get another copy of it soon."
952,3,"good book, poor printing.","  Cheap printing. some pages good, many just readable. For a foreign printing, they could use a little more ink to make quality even."
953,2,Bad: - This nasty chemical horror stink coming off ...,"  Bad:- This nasty chemical horror stink coming off this book is so strong to make it unusable for me- They didn't even bother to typeset this, they just printed an ancient PDF of the public domain copy, and it looks *terrible*. This is basically 3rd generation photocopy quality. Not only that, but the there is smudging throughout.Good:- Cover design is nice."
954,4,"Suppose to be amazing, bought it","  Suppose to be amazing, bought it, and now it sits on my book shelf. Basically it exists so that acquaintances that pass through my living quarters, think I am some sort of computer guy/ intellectual of sorts. Great conversation starter as long as you can think on the fly and don't encounter someone who has actually read it."
955,5,GREAT QUALITY & SUPER FAST DELIVERY,"  Impressed that I got the book in 24 hrs with all the bad weather. My son, was excited to get the book. Highly recommend"
956,4,Four Stars,  \0/
957,5,Five Stars,  I love having an electronic copy of my original C Programming language book.
958,3,Three Stars,  Started reading it most people say its a beginners book but everyone has their own way with coding.
959,3,THIS IS A SOLUTION BOOK!,"  The original book by Ritchie and Kernighan is a must have for every programmer, but this is a solution book, not the original text."
960,2,the original was better.,"  It's ok, the original was better."
961,5,Great,"  Everything you need to know to start to write in C. It does not constraint water, author is competent. Good choice for start."
962,3,the seminal book on c is .... small?,"  I don't know why I haven't read/seen this book before but I was surprised when I opened up the package and saw such a small book, don't get me wrong -- it covers a lot but I felt it could have been expanded on a bit"
963,4,Out of date,"  I liked it, but it is out of date."
964,3,Average.,"  Apart from having a black line in perminate marker through the pages in a 'new' book that i bought... it is good context and is helping me learn C programming language, starting from never knowing anything about it before."
965,3,Three Stars,"  Not too bad, some pages a bit dirty"
966,5,The book is good,  It has lots of words and things.  Also it talks about things like computers. This book is recommended if you just want to chill out and have a good time.  10/10 book of the year would buy again.
967,3,"It's okay, and useful for some.","  I'm not really a C coder, nor did I use this book for the class I rented it for."
968,2,Not for student who is starting to learn the language...,"  If you are not familiar with the basics of programming language, then this book will not be useful for you."
969,1,"answer guide, not the book.","  I expected this to be the textbook for K&R, but what I received was the answer guide to the exercises that are in the actual textbook. Nowhere in the product description did it say that that was what this would be--the description describes K&R, without saying that what you're actually ordering is the answer key. This is useless without the textbook, which is what I thought I was getting.Update: Amazon refunded my purchase without making me return the book. I then purchased the actual book. It's a great book, just beware that, at least for me, this link orders you the answer key, not the textbook."
970,1,1st vs 2nd...,  For me the 1st edition is a master piece and should be preserved and reedited.
971,1,One Star,  Not very useful.
972,1,Doers Often Make Terrible Teachers,"  I had high hopes for this book after reading all the glowing reviews, but unfortunately, in reading it I was reminded of so many of my college professors:  brilliant in their field yet stunted in their ability to convey key concepts to the student.  Unless you already know programming well, don't bother buying this book as anything other than an occasional reference.  Students of C are much better served by Kochan's 3rd or 4th edition on the language."
973,1,One Star,  Boring.
974,5,Five Stars,"  Most popular book for C programming, entering level."
