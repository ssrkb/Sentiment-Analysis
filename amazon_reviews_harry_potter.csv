0,5,Love it.,"I am pushing 30's but I still love Harry potter like I did when I was a teenager and today I gave it as a gift to a teenager who is new to the book world. The books arrived in a perfect condition, timely delivery, well packed and along with a book mark. None of pages are missing and the paper quality is too good no speck of yellow is seen even the print is good. The conversation carried out between Ron Hermione and Harry through letters are printed in different fonts and the rest in different which gives the whole book an interesting look. The new readers can feel the conversation actually happening in their mind like a play on radio."
1,5,First Book is the Best. No Damages. Perfect.,"Maximum childishness, minimum violence and absolutely awesome. The best in the series. Buy thisbook from u-Read Shop. People who got secondhand books may have bought USED. Go for it."
2,5,Perfectly Crafted Fantasy.,There's nothing more perfect u can ask for by JK Rowling. Its just magnificent.And thanks for the bookmarks.Fully satisfied with the delivery and the product.
3,5,And the magical journey begins AGAIN,"Having finished the UK version years ago, and to quench the desire to start all over again led me to buy this edition. Nominal changes in otherwise known story makes the journey a bit more interesting. Since the content of the book is already known to many, I am strictly sticking to the condition and quality of the book.The book was delivered to me in excellent condition, this version is a bit bigger and thicker than the Bloomsbury UK edition, and due to increased real estate of the book, contents of the pages seem a bit less congested. If you‚Äôre someone who loves a bit large and thick book in their hands go for the US edition instead of the UK one. Chapters too start with a small cartoon which is a nice touch. As can be noticed in the pictures provided  pages are a bit bright than UK one but truth be told might be because of the fact that the UK edition is with me for quite some time.Highly recommended‚Ä¶."
4,4,Page Turner!,"It is the first book in the Harry Potter series. I know, everybody love Harry Potter and here I am reviewing it anyway.LIKES: üòäüòä1) World Formation: The whole world building is mind-boggling. The wizarding world is very vast and intricately woven as it has witches, wizards, goblins, three-headed dog, dragon, centaurs, unicorns, and whatnot.2) Characterization: All the characters have been well thought out. No character looked like it's only there as a page filler. The book is full of variety of characters from kind-hearted to mean bullies. Step by step building of friendship between the trio (Harry, Ron and Hermione) is just a sight to behold. The unfolding of characters such as Hermione (from bossy know-it-all to a kind soul who acknowledges the efforts of others) and Neville (who being scardy cat all the time, summons up the courage to take a stand against Draco's minions as well as his friends) is inexplicable and neatly done.3) Writing: J.K. Rowling's writing is so vivid that you will wish you were a witch or wizard, too! Writing is simple which makes it easier to dive into. I love all the positivity spreading through her unique writing style and messages. Dersley family's characters is so well written that everyone abhor them to the core.4) Plot: Plot is very unique and intriguing with fast-paced and gripping story. A great plot twist at the end is an add-on bonus. The clues are nicely linked with the each other and very detailed as compared to the movies.DISLIKES: üòíüòí1)¬†I already watched all the movies before the book. Big mistake. So, plot twist at the end was a dead giveaway for me.2) The book is very similar to the movie, so i didn't get to enjoy as much as i should've. Totally my fault!Despite devouring the Harry Potter movie, i loved the book all the same. I recommend it to all the fantasy lovers out there. No matter what age group you belong to, this series is perfect for you. Highly recommended! üòäüôè"

9,5,Thanks J.K Rowling and amazon,"A fascinating novel of magic. I love the experience with harry potter, Ron Wesley and Hermione Granger. It has got a nice front cover also. Thank you Amazon, for packing it so carefully and for handling it with care."
10,5,You root for Harry !,"I am so glad I read this book. I would definitely have missed something if I hadn't picked this up. Such a gem of a book. The writing is so enormously beautiful. You literally imagine all the vivid details. The writing is so lucid and entertaining that you cant stop yourself from reading the book in one go. (But I didnt..) I think I read it in five or six sittings deliberately so I couldn't get over enjoying myself. Such a page turner and such a warm hearted story.You root for Harry throughout. You feel for the characters. A well executed plot. I can go on raving about this book but let me stop and yes, I will be buying the second part soon."

13,5,An absolute gem,"I have a confession to make. As much as I love the Harry Potter books and movies I hadn't read the first two books. I've watched all the movies and read all the other books and I really don't know how I've gone so long without reading these two. They always seemed to be checked out of the school library, or I could only find the abridged versions.I'm glad I finally bought my own copy because can I just say WOW. This is an absolute gem. Now I just have the second book left to read. I can't wait!"
14,5,An Awesome Beginning,"Harry Potter is my favorite book series ever. The movie adaptations are also quite good. I have read all the books before but buying it once again because of the new book covers. Keeping the story aside, the new cover arts are amazing.Story:I am probably reading Philosopher's Stone for the 4th time and every time I read, I discover new hidden secrets just like harry discovers many secrets about Hogwarts in his first year. JK Rowling is probably one of my favorite female author. The way she has engineered the stories is just brilliant. I also love the way she introduces the new characters to us, its ingenious. If you are someone who haven't read any one the Harry Potter books, then I will highly suggest to start with this book, taking in account that you love to read and explore new kingdoms. Not going deep into the story because you can already read the synopsis in this very page. If you have seen the movie first then reading this book, then you will get to know a ton of new plots but if you are planning to do the opposite, then be prepared to be somewhat disappointed. Nevertheless, Happy Reading.About the book and delivery:- The book was delivered on time.- The condition of the book was perfect, no torn pages.- I was expecting a bookmark from Amazon but was disappointed.- I will suggest to wait for a book sale because I got a 48% discount on this book."
15,5,The best series a must read,"I love this book this book is only for them who respect fantasy, mystery,drama and magic and want a abnormal life in the books the best book in the history that I have read in my life I also have it's cursed child part the both books are mind blowing and will be more than the real fantasy land.,and I wish I can be Harry Potter and live adventurous life I can write on this fabulous and brilliant book full day"
16,5,Awesome,"""If you are a Potter head than you are definitely fall in love with this  book.""J.k.ling , one of my most favorite and hearttouching author. As you would be knowing about her most awesome and imaginative book series 'Harry Potter' . Comingn to the point, today I would tell about the first part in this part, J.k. Rowling made the book as the world would be wanting. Fir instance, flying broomsticks , photos that takes passwords,an the most unbelievable game played on broomsticks (QUIDDITCH). According to me you is the best ever series I ever read till now.Tanav GuptaMind Tree SchoolClass - VI"
17,5,PHENOMENAL,WHAT A BOOK! I really don't know why did I not read this book before... Fantastic is the word... Beautiful writing by J. K. Rowling... Especially loved it because there's an Indian character in it... Loved even more because the character's surname is ' Patil ' ( Even my surname is ' Patil ')~ Aditya Patil
18,5,Delight for Potterheads,I am a big potterhead so definitely it was a treat for me üòçüòç! The story is narrated in such a magical way that you won't for a second feel out of the place.This book is ideal for everyone and specially for kids. The cover is very beautiful. Definitely go for it.
19,5,Amazing Read for every age!,"Though this book is a children's book, it can be read by anyone. You won't get bored no matter how many times you read. Whenever I get bored this series. I have read the whole series 15+ times. The English in this book is very easy compared to other books. Even a 10 or less can read, if he knows basic reading. The writing style of J.K.R is so good that I fully involve in the book, such that I see myself in the MAGICAL WORLD! In my view it did not lack anything. It had action, humour, even a little romance. If anyone is poor in English, I first recommend this book."
20,5,Engaging Story for Kids,"My daughter first saw all the Harry Potter movies and when she wanted more, I bought her the book. The book definitely has more content than the movie and allows you a greater engagement and enchantment. Now, she wants to read the sequel to this book."
21,3,The Book Was slightly Damaged.,The Book Was slightly Damaged and Papers And Back Cover Wear bent.Paper Quality-4Back cover-3Delivery-3Overall-3.8
22,4,OK,"Some words, fonts, etc missing or badly printed. But everyone knows the contents, so the book is usable."
23,5,You‚Äôre a wizard harry,"Still remeber the one sentence which changed everything,delve in to the amazing world of magic with harry.face challanges,unweal secrets, find missing relations,get awesome powers this is a powerhouse of teen age drama."
24,5,Its better to read this book instead of Movie.,i have watched all the harry potter movies but after reading this book i got to know that most of the scenes are chopped in the movie.from where did the hagrid got the flying motor bike . actually neville longbottom went to forbidden forest but in the movie ron went there. lots of unexplained scene are in the book.
25,1,Don't buy it,The book print was quite small..... The ink on the pages smudged...... The book cover was not proper as the paper was scratched and there were imprints not he book cover.... Very unhappy üòû with it
26,5,bookworm,"do i need to say any thing?? a gods gift for us bookworms who want (sorry NEED) a book to lul us to sleep at night, to keep us going through the length of the day and help us distribute oxygen in our body. enticing the first time you read and enticing the hundredth time you read."
27,5,Simply outstanding!!!!,"Pls pls don't mind the negative comments. I just can't believe how innovative thinker is this lady J.K. Rowling...! As you know the book is actually a masterpiece. If u have heard about harry Potter and haven't watched the film yet.....pls instead of watching the film , buy this and read the marvellous book. I got my first book in this series. And no words to describe. Lots of characters, and it rolls like the movie through your mind.....Pls buy it."
28,5,Magical.. Books are your Best friend!!,Okay so first the packaging was fab! I was so happy when I was opening the package.. The book is magical like you will just read and read... There were no bookmarks so don't think that Amazon is gonna give you free bookmarks. I got the book on 5th June and I finished it on 22nd June actually I was busy that's why.. but i am gonna get the 2nd book (Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets) and I'll try to finish it as soon as I can.. Books are the Best!!
29,5,Fantastic book!,"Seriously, you are seeing review of HARRY POTTER? This book is a masterpiece. I got the product in very nice condition and packaging. Thanks J.K. ROWLING for such a masterpiece. Finally, thanks AMAZON for free and fast delivery."
30,5,Highly recommended. I've summed up some points for review.üëåüëå,"Harry Potter and Wizarding World books have always been so fascinating. Being a Potterhead, I've always wanted to read the HP book series ...love it .‚Ä¢The pages are light.‚Ä¢ The binding of the book is also perfect for you to completely open the book (though in the starting it is slightly hard to do so.)‚Ä¢ The cover has vibrant illustrations with gold foiling for the title.‚Ä¢The font is of convenient size( Also there are different fonts for ""letters"", ""book names"")‚Ä¢ Plus, a bookmark by Amazon.Thank you Amazon.Would surely recommend the product."
31,5,MAGICAL MARVEL!!,"üåüOne of my favourite stories of all time! üéÉ It's just...MAGICAL!!ü¶âüë£A wonderful story about friendship, bravery, believing in oneself, having the courage to do the right thing and above all-magic!‚ú®üîÆP.S.

32,5,Marvellous,Reading this after a long time and I'm equallythrilled as the first time.This is one book that I suggest for every kid for the sheer imagination it propels.
33,5,Bachpan,"Full of sympathetic characters, wildly imaginative situations, and countless exciting details, the first installment in the series assembles an unforgettable magical world and sets the stage for many high-stakes adventures to come."
34,5,Awesome,Font is good. The English is super easy for kids who want to enjoy their reading time. Cover is kind of matte finish. The overall quality of book is good. The comment box is too short for explaining the harry potter series. Everyone knows its one of the classics and always will be.
35,4,Fantastic,"A boy who lives with horrible relatives, went to magic school, earn good friends and stop evil to back his life, which threatened the school and boy's life. Isn't the story good???... Oh come on, that's the best fantasy novel I read ever."
36,5,Marvellous,This is a great product I would like to give it 5 stars .... Really worth it the book is in great condition and the cover and everything is very much good..... The illustrations the dialogues the writings everything is outstanding..... And If you have seen the movie then also you can buy it lot more things rather than the movie.... If you're thinking of buying it go for it....
37,4,The packaging was not interesting....,The book was in good condition when I received it packaging was not put it was wrapped in just simple polythene rapper so . It must be improved but no doubt the book was exceptional it is made for every kind of reader ......

39,3,Bad condition of the Hardcover :(,"From outside: I received the book in a bad condition ... Although its a new edition and launched this month only, but the book I received, looks like an old book ... It has got some scratches and looks very dull.From inside: Very nice! I ordered the Slytherin one ... happy to read about some Slytherin history.I would recommend to order only the paperback book because it's got exactly same contents as in the hardcover one."
40,5,Its an amazing book. All sorts of interesting things,"Guys, it‚Äôs an amazing book. All sorts of interesting things... I couldn't put it down. I was reading the book in my school van, and the one minute gap when a teacher goes and the next enters, and all the time. Everyone must read it.Also if you are buying this book, I would presume that you‚Äôre just going to start reading the series... please READ ALL THE BOOKS FIRST AND ONLY THEN watch the movies... because I don‚Äôt want you to spoil your imagination of the world of Harry PotterYou wouldn‚Äôt believe it... the books were so, so intriguing that I opened the book and closed it the first time when I was done reading it.... worth buying.... please read all books... Afterwards this, I recommend you all to start with the Percy Jackson series, followed by Heroes Of Olympus etc.."

Had a Hogwarts map in it also fun facts about J. K Rowling which is not in the above pictures. Also there is a biiiiiig surprise at the end (not in the pictures)  also I gave a sneak peek of the first three pages. The first n second chapters are kinda boring. But the 3 rd chapters is where things start getting interesting

60,5,Good but no pictures,Love for Harry Potter...Then get it... But it does not includes any type of pictures everywhere there are words only. If you are starting reading go for book with pictures but if you need to read only then get this one. Also quality of images is as per price.

1202,5,Just Amazing!~ No Words!!!!!!,"‚ùùThis boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.‚ùûEveryone grew up with Harry Potter. They read all the books when they were young and watched all the films. They would re-watch and re-read them. They would fall in love with the Wizarding World and would completely adore Harry, Ron, and Hermione. They would talk about them non stop, about Hogwarts, about its teachings, about them wanting to become students there and pretending they are, about joining the HP fandom, about loving every character and instantly missing the world. Everyone would adore Harry Potter and knew about it since they were young ones.Except me.Ex claimer-BASED ON A TRUE STORY.I didn't grow up with Harry Potter. Not because I didn't get to, but because I chose not to. I know, it's like living a life where everything has been a lie. Worse even. It's just, the movies would appear on my tv. From the first one, to the next and the next, and every time I saw the trailer for the upcoming one, I wouldn't be interested and would skip it when I came to it. I wouldn't bother and wouldn't care, and that made a big problem in my life now. Here I am now, being left out because of such poor choices and decisions I made when I was 7, 8, 9, and older until now. But now, as 2016 and having over 100 friends that are caught up and have read the recently published novel, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, I have finally read the first book and am able to continue the series and watch the films. Now, here I am, wishing to go back to my past and change this nightmare and actually watch the films or read the books because I have literally missed on so much, missed too much, and have been missing too much. I have been out of this world and never realized how good it is, and how special it already has become.""There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.""All the first timers ORDER now and finish it.""Petrificus Totalus""~Search It"
1203,5,An obvious and necessary read,"I don't think I need to write a lot, because Harry Potter is self explanatory. The plots, characters, timing, dialogue, and everything else is beyond brilliant. Don't think, just go for it. However, if you're a person like me, who lives for pretty covers, I suggest that you buy the Children's covers, which are livelier and more attractive."
1204,1,Book does not look original,"Book does Not look origina.  Left one is original, right one I got."
1205,5,what a great book! a master piece by jk rowling,what a great book! a master piece by jk rowling.the cover looks great and the map of hogwarts looks magical.arrived in great ease and in a low price too.a must buy one.and a must know thing is that if one likes harry potter then he must read these books rather than watch films because books are detailed and each and every thing present in book is not in the films.
1206,5,Harry Potter Series - Review on Kindle version,"I practically grew up reading Harry Potter series.  I am a big fan of JK Rowling.This review is for the Kindle version of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.I am so happy that we book reading now has become so easy through devices like Kindle. I totally loved the Kindle version. It not only made lot easier, I get to carry my favorite book everywhere i go."
1207,5,These covers seem to have a life of their own.,"I saw these covers digitally and I was not impressed but now after actually glancing them over, I realised these are the best covers I have ever seen in my life. They immerse you inmmeadieatly* in this world. No need to buy hardcover version though. Fast delievery* thanks amazon :)"
1208,5,Truly Magical!,I just love Harry Potter series of books and movies. Always wondered about J.K. Rowling's writing and imagination skills. She is the second writer I admired after Dan Brown. I was so excited to get my first Harry Potter book. Just loved the front cover and paper print. Can't wait to read it... Planning to buy the next volume in Harry Potterseries through Amazon.
1209,5,If only it had options of more stars,"Why did I waste all these years! I don‚Äôt know where to start. This book has become so close to my heart. Although I have just read the first three parts, weirdly, I feel like I was already a part of #hogwarts but never got a chance to accept the truth. This book is makes you understand so many things about life, how to deal with your situations, the subtle difference between good and evil, this book is an accumulation of life itself!A proud gryffindor saying this."
1210,3,Book was good but printing quality was poor.,"The book has a lot of suspense, very thrilling but I received the product in not very great condition, printing quality was very bad, black patches in the middle of pages, half the words are blur. I would suggest buying the book from a bookstore like crossword.(Hope you can see the picture clearly)"
1211,5,"HARRY POTTER, The name is Enough","No, no, And absolutely No comments for the content of the book. Its not just a book, its a time traveling mechine that takes you to your childhood (Only if you have met the happiness of getting know the wizard world earlier).And very good services from amazon. Packaging was good. No disput found.I got the book at ‚Çπ199 though the price is a little higher now."
1212,5,what a writing ! just awesome !,Its a must read for everyone who believes in fairytale. Even it is a must read for all who dare not. It helps to unravel the hidden potentitalty of every common man by making them feel special. Far better than the movie. Wish I could afford to buy it when I was too young as it is my childhood dream to go through Harry Potter series. Thanks Amazon.
1213,2,The story is amazing no doubt in it but I'm really disappointed as ...,The ratings for the book are neither for HARRY POTTER SERIES nor for J.K. Rowling. The book which I've received have a cover page of different colour not same as the picture shown. The story is amazing no doubt in it but I'm really disappointed as being a POTTERHEAD I just ordered this book for my collection and it turned out to be in a bad condition.
1214,5,SUPER,"SUPERB!this book of harry potter is super. You have to buy this one, the front cover is super and there is a map of hogwards school of witchcraft and wizardry."
1215,5,"The novel is beautiful, of course here I am not rating the ...","I can't even think to rate it in less than 5 stars . The novel is beautiful, of course here I am not rating the content because no doubtingly that's incredible but the quality of book is also amazing."
1216,5,HP: Name Itself Said All,It is a legacy in Novel History. All the characters are constructed in a manner of excellence. It extend our imaginations beyond the limit. Best Ever Book Series. Everyone should possess this set of HP started with Philosopher's Stone. Like the title this book have Elixir Of Life among readers forever.
1217,5,A highly recommended read.,"I always had a prejudice that fantasy books are not good. But after being highly recommended by a friend to read Harry Potter, I thought of giving it a shot. And it turned out to be one of the best reading experience ever. The best thing is it provokes vivid imagination and takes you in a different world altogether. A must read for all age groups. Looking forward to other books in the series."
1218,5,The story of young Harry Potter,Book was great and original.
1219,5,... now and believe me I have not seen a better page and print and picture quality than this,I have received this book just now and believe me I have not seen a better page and print and picture quality than this! It has a map of the Harry Potter magical world. And the weight is just appropriate. The cover has a matt finish. I think it is you should go for it. No Doubts.
1220,5,lovely,Harry potter is an orphan living with his uncle aunt and a cousin. He has no idea of his powers or that he is going to be a great wizard. Neither he knows that his parents too were great witch and wizard. A welcome guest in the form of rubeus hagrid revels harry's true identity to him and that he is to go to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. And thus begins a joy ride of a book packed with adventure and excitement. The duel with Lord voldermort at the end is really exciting. You will love it and I don't have a bit of doubt regarding this. I enjoyed it a lot.
1221,5,"Amazing book, orignal one ,no damage ,delivered on time",The book is amazing .Delivered on time no damaging .And its the original one .so if you to be amazed just buy it start exploring a different world of magic.
1222,5,NEED NO INTRO............,"THIS BOOK IS JUST AWESOME..........FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME.I fell in love with Harry Potter the first time I read this book ‚Äì some time in 1999, I think. And all that magic surrounding him ‚Äì I just lapped it all up. The characters that pop out of the book and dance in front of one‚Äôs eyes as you read the words is nothing short of amazing ‚Äì I got transported into a different realm. Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, Neville, Dumbledore, Malfoy, Snape and most important of all ‚Äì you-know-who ‚Äì what kind of research and imagination must have come together to create these!Enjoy being a kid once again!!"
1223,5,BUY IT!,I've watched the movies before reading the books. A lot of people suggested me to read the books (even though I've watched the films) and boy were they right! JK Rowling's writing is so magnificent that i just cannot explain. Despite of knowing everything I was still turning pages like i didn't know anything. It's that good.
1224,5,Five Stars,The story is amazing obviously but the cover's colour is not the same as the picture given.
1225,1,Duplicate product do not buy,This review is about the quality. After page no. 84 the next page is 117. The middle pages are missing. Very disappointing.
1226,5,And I'm totally in love with the cover print,I received this and another book within just 24 hours. And I'm totally in love with the cover print. It's so beautiful. Amazon has never failed to impress me. üëçüëçüëç

1228,5,Best book ever!,The best book for every age. You're missing out on a lot in life if you haven't read the entire series yet!
1229,5,Brilliant. The life of a boy changed as he ...,Brilliant. The life of a boy changed as he came to know that he was a wizard. The story was magical. Written in the most lucid way.Looking forward for the next part. I'll buy it someday and read asap.

1233,5,Breathtakingly stunning edition of the well loved 1st book of the Harry Potter series!!!!!,"A gorgeous edition for collectors and fans alike, this deluxe version of the illustrated harry potter and the philosopher's stone is simply stunning. With sophisticated line art by Jim Kay on the purple cloth covered slipcase and the book itself, this is definitely something to treasure for a lifetime! The book itself is very heavy and large with high quality premium grade paper and gilt edges , accompanied by a huge diagon alley poster. Of course the book is a little expensive but I'm damn sure that it's worth each and every penny. Simply awesome. Just go for it."
1234,5,Bewitching!,"Late into the night at a stay over my friends house, completely devoid of sleep, I somehow muttered a meek promise to my friend. One to give Potter a try. Thank heavens, I did! It doesn't matter whether you're a 6 year old or in your twenties, J.K. Rowling opens a whole newworld of magic and takes you on a ride you'd be happy to hop on! And once you finish reading this absolutely-fantastic book, you can't wait to get your hands on the next part!"
1235,5,Amazon delivered it rather fast and quite beautifully. I love these editions of the books,Harry Potter by itself doesn't need an introduction but I will give a review for the product. Amazon delivered it rather fast and quite beautifully. I love these editions of the books. The covers are so beautiful!

This is how fantasy genre should be.Must read once in your life time.Good service by amazon and recieved product in just three days but only one regret AMAZON forget to give bookmark with this book.Earlier amazon used to give bookmsrkswith every book as I have purchased some books from same series earlier.so one star deducted for that else everything is great.I am a fan of witty and sometimes funny bookmarks by AMAZON.

1238,5,AWESOME!!!,"The people who say harry potter books are boring are wrong. Harry potter books are one of the best series ever written.

1246,4,Careful with the packaging Amazon,"If you are a Potterhead, go for it!I've always wanted to have my own set rather than asking from friends. N now I've started collecting. The book is the entry into the magical world for those who believe it. Really it's awesome!I do have a complain about the packaging. I ordered three books. When I received them, they were just crammed into a bubble wrap pack instead of a box. One of the books got folded in the edges. Lucky this one was alright."

1259,5,Would you judge and review bible?,"Alright gather around!!! Collect your tickets here for we have for you an amazing persona who has not read Harry potter in her life and yes that person would be me.Yeah yeah I know that I have to have been living under a rock to have not read this book yet. But at least I was aware of the series. So why finally read it?a)One of my book soul mate have been practically begging me to do sob)Let‚Äôs just say that there is this one person who may have not even bothered to read a shopping receipt in her life, let alone a book. So turns out that even this person has read harry potter series and even have all the seven books in her collection and when that person mocks you about having not read Harry potter, then you know things have gone bad and that you are doomed and you should pile up on the potter series as fast as you can, so that you could shut the person up.You should know about me that my room has furniture made out of books because that‚Äôs how massive my collection and addiction to books is and apparently none of them is a harry potter book. Apparently not having read a Harry potter book makes me some kind of outlaw and sinner in the book world so fearing the wrath of book gods, I have finally read my first harry potter book. (so open up the best bottle in your collection and we will have party at your house)So leaving all the crap aside‚Ä¶let‚Äôs talk about the bookThere is practically nothing that you can say that has not been said before. Yes the book is intriguing, grasping and full of fun element. It is something that any age can immerse themselves into without regrets. No doubt I want to go through the entire series. There are elements and magic world details that need your undivided attention. In whole, the book is pretty good and one hell of a read."

1292,5,Five Stars,Great
1293,5,Distracting!!,It is the one of the best fiction I have ever read. Though I have watched the movies..all of the special effect have crumbled down under it. A small piece of advice for the ones reading it- If you are busy don't start reading else your work is gone up in flames. It is one of the most distracting book as well ^_* I too was distracted....I could not concentrate on other things until i finished it. ^_^ But I don't mind....waiting for other books of the series :D please deliver it soon.. :(
1294,5,The content is great! There's even a map,"You never need an excuse to buy a harry potter novel! This series is a real treat! The content is great! There's even a map!!! Speaking about the quality of the book it is in good condition. The cover is a bit folded here and there but then again for such price, the book was in good condition."
1295,5,a letter to muggles who have put the one star.,"i am writting this letter to rhe people who have put one star. when people look or read reviews they always look out for one star rating reviews. i have done it myself. most of the reviews are stating that their hard copy is in an abysmal condition.well, to solve that problem follw these simple steps.1. downlaod the amazon kindle app2. make yourselves an account.3. buy your desired book.it comes as a soft copy. this might be a setback but there are two advantages.1. it comes in an amazing condition2. you can edit it to your liking.3. it comes in half the price. so again, there is a solution to your problem. or just call up amazon and ask for a better version.with regards-Albus Dumbeldore.:)-"
1296,5,Now after I finished the book I just realised that the guy who reviewed the book was completely wrong I found the book very easy,I am a 13 year old boy and at first I thought that this book was not for my age when I read one of the reviews. But still I ignored it and I bought the book. Now after I finished the book I just realised that the guy who reviewed the book was completely wrong I found the book very easy to read even an 10 year old could understand it.Anyways the book was very nice and interesting and made me purchase the Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets. The book delivery was very fast I got it the very next day.the cover of the book was very smooth and it is the best quality cover for books. The book also contains an awesome bookmark.thank you Amazon and thank you jk.Rowling
1297,3,Not worth the price tag,"Do not get me wrong. There is no substitute to Harry Potter books. The quality of this particular edition is excellent as well. But the cost simply does not justify the end product. there are NO extra artworks above the normal illustrated version and except for a poster of diagon alley (which I am SURE u can get printed for a fraction of the cost of the book), there is nothing extra in the deluxe edition. Adding the fact that the illustrated version has the same dimensions and costs a 20th the price of the deluxe edition, the price tag cannot be justified at all. Even as a collector, I would say that the publishers could have at least included an autograph of the author herself.Sorry, but I really cannot justify the costs. The story and the artwork deserve 5 stars themselves of course"
1298,1,Worst product ever,"I give zero rating.Book was dirty ,not printed properly.I believe this book wasn't the original one at all and refurbished book was delivered to us which is totally unacceptable.I wouldn't recommend anyone purchasing this via amazon.Such a pathetic product."
1299,4,A epic journey into a magical world,"I choose this rating because I don't want to give it 5 stars, since this is the first ever novel I have read and it just wouldn't be fair to say that this is the best novel I have ever read.But at the same I don't wanna give it less than 4 stars because this is the first time I have ever read a novel and it kept me engaged even though I have watched the movies.The things I like about this book is that it answers many questions which is hard to think of when you are watching a movie and there is more in the book than it is in the movie.The thing I disliked about this book is that it is a little hard to understand some words but since this is my first ever novel I have read this problem has got to do with me more than it has got to do with the book also the way hagrid speaks is a little hard to understand.At last I would recommend this book to the people who loves reading novels about fantasies, supernatural, and magical worlds and the people who have watched the Harry Potter movies but have not read the books, it helps to see the story in a different way and angle, also there is a lot more here than it is in the movie."

1301,5,Pick It Up Irrespective Of Your Age,"I never thought that I would be giving 5 stars to a kid's fantasy series. Primarily a non-fiction reader, I decided to read something light in fiction and with up the first book of the Harry Potter Series. Picked it thinking to give a shot on the much talked about best in fiction, so what if its from the kid's section.Today when I finish this book, I am astonished by the impact it has left after the last chapter. Once you get the hang of Hogwarts there is no looking back. You just keep sinking into it and start visualizing every nuance of Rowling's fantasy world.The story weaves humour, friendship, bravery, courage all into a magical world which doesn't leave you. Even after the book ends, you are left curious and longing to pick the next book."
1302,5,a very valuble book for me,This book is very amazing it may be quit expensive but my experience with it was not was but is.I am really feeling very lucky to be to go ahead with this book and i finnaly buyed reafter i have done a good reserch on it by seeing videos on YouTube and searhing on google it worth money and i advice  you to watcht videos of it on YouTube and if want to see the book review of harry potter and the philosopher stone as i am a youtuber i have made a video on it please visit my channel my channel name is kids fun learning with navyathank you
1303,2,No good grammar,"The book was  actually pretty good but it had several grammatical errors and spelling mistakes. I just think children shouldn't read this book as it could spoil their spellings  and grammar. I hope JK Rowling works on the following in her future books. Let me tell you this, that the  story is extremely good and people who just love fantasy like me will surely love  this book."
1304,3,Three Stars,good one
1305,5,Best series ever,"I read this book for the sixth time in my life. This period of quarantine and the time right now filled with uncertainty and bad news all around the world. I really needed to look for some positivity for bringing my sanity back.This is when I went to my bookshelf and picked up my old copy of the Harry Potter and the Philosopher‚Äôs Stone. And just like my childhood, for one day at least I was taken to this magical world where everything was perfect. This book never fails to amaze me and never fails to bring the greatest smile on my face.I think re-reading Harry Potter is the best thing that can be done right now for the peace of mind anyone is looking for in these difficult times."
1306,5,It was a magical adventure!,"Ok so, firstly I am thankful that my father who doesn't know anything about Harry Potter just recommend me Harry Potter as it's famous. At first, I didn't want to read the books or watch the movies, I swear. Then, i thought just to try the movies. So, I watched the first one. I was spellbound, watched the second and so on, watched all of them.Then, I wanted to read the books. Well, about the book. It's definitely worth reading and in a good quality. Now, I have read all the books and my father is irritated by my regular Harry Potter references.It's really a good read. I am positive if you will read the first book you won't stop until the last.üíïWell, mischief managed."
1307,5,My Favorite Book Series!,"The Harry potter series are the best novels series I have ever read. This is the third time I am going to read the all the books of the series a over again. I never get bored reading the Harry Potter series! And I have also got a kindle (with kindle unlimited) from which I can read the book any time I want!I highly reccomend this book to anyone, who is new to the wizarding world!"
1308,5,A Magical Page-Turner epic,"Plot: Harry Potter is an orphan, mistreaded by his aunt and unce, Mr and Mrs Dursley and constantly being bullied by his cousin Dudley. However, he always makes inexplicable things happening around him, and gets punished for them. All of this is explained when Hagrid explains that Harry is a wizard, and sens him to a magical school, Hogwarts. There he is famous and makes many friends, and two for life: Ron Weasely and Hermione Granger.With the help of magical wit, guidance of his friends, and by stumbling across things by sheer coincidence, Harry has to solve mysteries.The villian, Lord Voldemort had been destroyed years ago due to some unknown power possessed by Harry, and haunts Harry's first year to seek revenge.Harry has to stop him, and has to save Hogwarts.Review: Harry Potter is one of the magical epics of the world. J.K Rowling, with those bewitching and enchanting words of her, has really taken the characters we use to hear in Fairy Tales to a next level.The language is lucid, but the plot is riveting and evocative. There are jerks and twists along the story. One minute you read,'No more dragon -- Malfoy in detention -- what could spoil their happiness?'And the next.'The answer was waiting at the fot of the stairs...they had left the Invisibility Cloak at the top of the tower.'She has created a world that co-exists with our own, which is what makes the story so believable.It it also easy to connect with, because it also has things and places that we normally do; a bank(Gringotts), a school(Hogwarts), a government(Ministry of Magic) and even Shopping Alleys!It also faces real-life problems, like being under the pressure of entering a new school in a young age, not being able to complete homework, getting selected in sports teams, going through detentions, sneaking things out of school and so on, even though they are magical, which helps us to connect with characters.In Toto, you will find that you simply can't keep the book down till you devour each word of it. It really is really the book that defines the magical zeitgeist."
1309,5,Once in a lifetime read,Harry Potter woke up an entire generation to reading. HP is to the world what sun is to the solar system.Pros:Never get boredGrippingEasy to readWell developed charactersLinear story lineTight plotInspirationalInstills faithCons:JK Rowling is not writing anymore HP series :(
1310,5,Im now a Potter head!,"Hey. My name is akshath and a loooong time a go i read this book.I know,I know it is a very long book .Kids in this time and age wont read that much pages, but it is a very very good book.It contains lots of fantastic words as well as the wonderfull detail!The detail is so amzing that you are  able to imagine everything like: The gryffindor common room,Nearly headless nick,  the hogwarts hall, and evem the quidditch matches !!!!!(If u are wondering why u cant imagine the characters its beacuse i already know how they look before reading the book)So if you ever come across this book be sure to get it for free! And wait... also a great Hats of to J.K Rowling and her amazing books! Plus if yuo have a kindle like me or the ap besure to read ALLL THE BOOKS FOR FREE! Byee! Im of to read Order of the phenoix the fifth Hp book"
1311,4,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,"I really enjoyed reading this book, it's about a boy who lives in the broom closet in his uncles house who manages to make it to Hogwarts, a school for wizards and witches. This book is one of those books that gets the plot stuck in my head and then I walk around all day thinking about it. If you're thinking about getting only one book in the series, this book is going to leave you in suspense. So this all in all a wonderful book that I think anyone will love. People who crave fantasy, this is all for you."
1312,4,A lot better than expected,"I started reading Harry Potter books to know more about the serious events that takes places from the 5th movie onwards, after everyone has grown up (the 3rd one being an exception, I loved Prisoner of Azkaban). First four books are more like what I have to get done with, to begin the fifth (when everything suddenly becomes dark). I didn't thought I'd enjoy the beginning ones this much, but this book was really a lot better than what I expected. Few things I like more in the book than the movies, and similarly, few things I like in the movies more. But if liked the first book (in which all our protagonists are just kids), I'm pretty sure I'll enjoy the next books in the series as well."
1313,5,THE WORLDS MAGICAL BOOK,"I loved it it has many difficult pronouncing words it is a very special books for adults and children.I loved the spells also my favourite spell is (Wingardion leviosa) I loved the character's  Rubies Hagrid,Ron Weasly,Hermione Granger,Albus Dumbledore,Proffesor Mconical,and the hero of this series, Harry Potter .

1317,5,Worth the money,"BOOK REVIEW: HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONEName of book: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stoneAuthor : JK RowlingPublications: BloomsburyNo. Of pages: 332Cost of book: 399 INRGenre : Fantasy fictionHarry potter is undoubtedly one of the most unprecedented and appreciated books of all times. This book , within two decades has received immense love and appreciation from 'potterheads' worldwide. The fame received by this book is uncommon due to the vast majority of people liking the book. Written by JK Rowling,  this book has sold over 48 million copies and has been a fan favourite since it was first published.The book is in form of narrative with its genre catering to people who like fantasy fiction.The book opens in number 4 , Privet Drive and introduced is ' the boy who lived' , Harry Potter, who has to deal with a miserable life of living in a storeroom, using glasses stuck  with scotch tape and going through his share of ordeal by being constantly bullied by his cousin , Dudely.But his life takes a complete turn when mysterious letters start coming to his 'house'. Initially reluctant to read those letters , his relatives have to read the letters when a genial half giant , called Rubeus Hagrid , comes to his house with an invitation of studying magic at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.It is then revealed that Harry Potter's parents were murdered by Voldermort and Harry , miraculously survived Voldermort's attack , bearing only a lightning bolt scar on his forehead.And then starts Harry's magical journey in Hogwarts.  He makes friends , fights bullies , learns about the fantastic game of Quidditch and most importantly  uncovers the secret behind the PHILOSOPHER'S STONE.The book has been written ensuring that it does not go out of place with young readers and thus has included everyday situations so that the book is more approachable to tweens. Harry is very much like all of us- confused yet courageous.The twists and turns in the book keep the readers glued to the book and the narration is fabulously done. The language is lucid and the vocabulary has been wisely chosen. The loose ends of the book are tied with expertise as more threads become compellingly unravelled.This book is a souvenir in English literature and is a paragon of the 21st century literature,  which is suitable for all age groups, be it young adults, children and even adults!Taking my opinion,  this book surely deserves a try and is going to stay with you forever as you embark on the magical journey with Harry and his friends."
1318,5,#Potterhead #Loved it,"HP is just a classic. It is an awesome , outstanding , amazing , read . I am a huge HP fan and I am reading the whole series for the 10th time. It is still exciting to read. I love JK Rowling's books. This is a great read. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY HIIIGGGHHLLLLYYYY RECOMEND IT."
1319,5,Addictive as Drugs.,"It's a shame that the amount of story that's in the book is not seen in the movies. J. K. Rowling makes no mistake in taking the reader into a never seen world of imagination and ecstasy. Though i watch the films over and over till today, I miss the amount of detail in he book vs the film. If you are new to reading, then trust me.. there can be no other book than this, that can hover you imagination that you had never tasted before. It's more addictive than drugs, amazingly admirable and devastatingly beautiful that it holds the reader to itself on how's the next page is going to be. Have to admit that Ms Rowling has a very blessed hand of creativity."
1320,5,Enter the world of magic!,"The first part of the amazing Harry Potter series is as enchanting as all the other parts. The introduction of the characters, the story, the humour and of course the thrill and magic involved have the ability to transport you into a whole new world from which one wouldnt feel like coming out.Ive read this book many times now and it's always a different experience each time!"
1321,4,Magic !! Magic!!  Magic!!,"This is a magnificent work done by the author, a book which engages the readers in every single page. Wonderful story and well written by the author. Harry and his friends give us a joyful experience in the magical school of Howgards. Will i get a chance to study in the school?? that's the question every kid ask to their parents after reading this amazing book."
1322,5,What an amazing read.,"Had watched the movies so many times. But reading the book is entirely a different thing, although the script is very much same. Loved the writing style of J K, she has an amazing narration style ane her imagination is just stupendous. Thank you for these books."
1323,2,Ok,It's good and meanful but the book that I got was having terrible English and to was written as ter an you was written as yeh
1324,5,The bestüòçüòçüòç,"What is there not to like this  series!!!?? It is simply the best..  Harry Potter is a household name.  The plot, the characters everything is so well planned and detailed..  Everything is brought from the base of the books.. The philosopher stone. I like how each and every book is dependent on each other..  So much interesting. Highly recommend.. You 'll love it.."
1325,5,Potterheads ... It's a treat for you‚ù§,"Best book!!! Best story, after all.. It's the infamous HP story. The whole series of 7 books make the story complete. And it's not children's book, though the cover might suggest it, but, it's better for teenagers after 11. Some people don't understand the value of this Wizarding World for what they don't understand the story (muggles tbh). Just go for it ‚ù§"
1326,4,Harry Potter and the philosophers stone,"The book was really interesting loved it.My favourite characters were Harry Potter, Hermione Granger,Ronald Weasley and Rubeus Hagrid.Though I think the begining was a little confusing I nearly wanted to stop reading but because I went on I was introduced to the Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry,Quidditch,Potions class etc.I really recomend this book and the rest of the series because it is amazing"
1327,5,Awesome. What else can you expect from harry potter and J.K Rowling?,"Well, just to tell, this piece will stay as fresh and enjoyable as you read for the rest of your life, as many times you read it.Some piece of info fokr newbies to harry potter series, enjoy the characters as much as you want NOW, at the end Professor Albus Dumbledore, Professor Severus Snape and all are gonna die. The problems, you'll probably fall in love with them till that time, and surely will cry (at least from inside)."
1328,5,Excellent book,"I dont know any person who won't enjoy this magnificent book written by J.K Rowling. I throughly enjoyed reading the adventures of Harry, Ron and Hermione. We have got ourselfs a lot time due to covid and many of are thinking of how to spend the time. Seriously this book is great for spending time. Once read you will feel to read next and next. When you finish reading you be curious to know what will happen next and get the next book. Full of magic and entertainment which take you through the wizarding world...."
1329,5,Don‚Äôt Ever Pick This Book Otherwise You Will A Wizards,"What is the story about?This story is about a boy named Harry potter whose parents had died when he was baby by a bad person.

Have a nice time reading it!"
1330,5,I JUST WISH I COULD WAVE MY WAND AND TRANSPORT MYSELF INTO THE HARRY POTTER  UNIVERSE,"Being a book lover myself I can happily say that this according to me IS THE BEST SERIES OF BOOKS EVER WRITTEN . I can still remember thet my father always told me that I must read Harry Potter ,but I never listened to him .Then finally one day I decided to go and buy the first book (philosopher's stone ) . I remember going from bookstore to bookstore not being able to find it. Then ... FINALLY  I found it . That day when I came back home I read for five hours straight no break and finished it , my first thought after I read this book was that why did I not listen to my father?.The thing that I enjoyed most about this book and series is that it can be read by all ages you don't have to be a kid to read the Harry Potter series you could even be 81 and still read this book without saying ""oh it's too kiddish"".. I also enjoy the friendship between Ron ,Harry and Hermione and how they all stand up for each other and protect them from harm ..J.K. Rowling has also added many quotes inside this book spoken by various characters ,some that have a deepmeaning that needs to be understood . for example""LIGHT CAN BE FOUND EVEN IN THE MOST DARKEST OF PLACES IF ONLY ONE REMEMBERS TO SWITCH ON THE LIGHT ""and some which simply say what they mean . For example""WE ALL HAVE GOOD AND BAD INSIDE OF US . BUT WHAT MATTERS IS PART WE CHOOSE TO ACT ON"".to end this review all I can say is thatthank you J.K. Rowling for introducing me to the wizarding world which will always have a special place in my heart."

1343,5,amazing!,hats of to JK Rowling or wrting such an amazng seroes of books...the part where hagrid misspells words (55pg) is one of the many  comical instances in the book that makes it very intresting and unique...one of my favourites ....

1346,5,One of my favourites,Re-read this for the umpteenth time. The tiny details and references are outstanding! JK Rowling is the greatest witch of all time! Even greater than Dumbledore!
1347,5,Fantabulous,"I am a 10 year old and I have seen all the Harry Potter movies  literally 4-5times. I have never read any books till now of the series because I suspected it was too long. But J.K Rowling's fanciful way of writing ,it's just amazing. I actually felt my hopes falling when Flint blocked him from getting hold of the snitch. Overall, I recommend this book to all avid readers"
1348,5,HARRY POTTER FOREVER !!!,"the series make me such a potterhead that sometimes I wish I was in the harry potter series and magic was real‚Ä¶ sadly it is not, but the harry potter wizardry, magic and delight will live in me forever no matter at all what other people say about me!!!"
1349,5,Awsome book the twist and turns where prefect,Wow really a awsome book i learned many new words from this book i understood that it is not too easy to write a prefect story like this i really didn't expect that nicolas famel was introduced before itself that was really shocking first it was not considered as important but at the point when there was a question who is nicolas famel he was introduced as important that was a really superb book! sure i will continue reading thank u!!
1350,4,THE BEST FANTASY OF THE WORLD,"Life can turn a person's tables upside-down suddenly; it could be bad or it could be good. This is what happens with Harry Potter: the boy who lived. Goodness is always paid in life in one form or the other and after ten long years of TORTURE, Harry potter's goodness pays off. He enters a new world, a world where magic dominates over everything and to his utter surprise Harry is famous out there instead of being called a dumb because he knows nothing about magic. In his first year at Hogwarts, Harry crosses all the obstacles with sheer courage and bravery. A salute to J.K. Rowling for her undefeatable imagination. The book was interesting from the starting till it ended and that is for what I liked it the most. After reading this book, I am sure that if a reader has not read Harry Potter, he hasn't entered the literary world."
1351,5,All time favourite,"Potter books are always lit af. And even so interesting as they take me to hogwarts everyy time I read these books for an awsome adventure of pleasure and excitement for my bored soul! I love getting completelyy dissolved into this magic world and be a part of JK rowlings' flawless and so remarkable thoughts and writings. Experiencing everywhere with magical thinking , I feel as my letter to hogwarts can anytime arrive! which I definately wish will. Just love every time these books atteracts readers like me towards them and we get lost in their world as if we always existed there' .How incredible can anyone put their thoughts into words! We should obviously learn this 'art' from youu _JK rowling mam. I love you and your so perfect thoughts. Thank youu so much!"
1352,5,harry potterstar world,thiswas the first book of harry potter read by me i thought it was boring but whe i read it i was lost in it what a strange world it was for harry going to king cross station at 11:00am he got two best friends ron and hermoine the were his two companions for the rest of his life he had to learnmany spells
1353,2,High cost for poor quality paper.  Search for other publications,"Most of the reviews mentioned here are for the Harry Potter story and not for the book quality. I ordered library binding for my neice, as it was her first Harry Potter book. I had to return it because of the below points1. Poor quality paper. Cost is high (1200+) for this quality.2. Almost no pictures anywhere in the book (some reviews do talk about pictures, but I did not find any)"
1354,5,Just buy it.,"why are there only 7 books :( very nice storyline and as a potterhead, I think much more people should read this....Best part is....It's LeviOsa not LeviosA... :)"
1355,5,Magical Beginning,"The best is just beginning! J.K Rowling's brilliant writing is nothing short of pure magic!!!! Every word, phrase and sentence is sprinkled with a bit of it....."
1356,5,Best book I have ever read!!!!,J.K Rowling's books are the best I have ever read. They each provide a unique story. They keep the readers wanting for more. I reccomend to first to read the Harry Potter books and then watch the movies. J.K Rowling is the best author ever!! I reccomend this book for all ages except the ones before seven becausd it has no illustrations in it. But I definitely reccomend this book.
1357,5,NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE IT !!!!!,How on earth can someone dislike this book!!! We are Harry Potter fans. Don't stop after reading the first book itself. Go ahead and read until you finish the last page of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. This book is enough to kindle anyone to become a lover of books. No book can match this series. I passionately recommend to everyone. Its INCREDIBLE.
1358,5,Amazing... and NO BUTS,Harry potter is amazing!! JK Rowling is a genius. She has written every book in the series with such flair and there are no words to describe her awesome books...
1359,5,REVIEW FOR HARRY POTTER üòÑü§†üëæ,"I AM A BIG FAN OF HARRY POTTER AND I EVEN SAW HARRY POTTER MOVIES IN THAT MOVIES I MOSTLY LIKE THESE MOVIES : HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS , HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS PART 1 AND HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS PART 2 IN THESE MOVIES HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS PART 2 AND HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS IS MORE AMAZING AND EXITING AND INTERESTING"
1360,5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS,I like how J.K Rowling added twist in this book. She also teaches people not to judge a book by its cover. This symbolises the that judging people needs to stop.[spoiler]The golden trio realise that Snape is trying to protect the stone from quirrel aka vodermort. By keeping an eye on snape they were not noticing what quirrel was doing.
1361,5,The same amusement even after 12 years,I had stopped reading books lately.  I just couldn't get to go more than 10 pages.  Then an idea stuck me.  Let's try to read Harry Potter again and maybe I will get back my reading habit.  I was not wrong !! I was smoothly able to finish this book even though I have read it twice before more than 12 years ago...and watched Movies also. Still this book just holds the reader üòÅ  Loved it !
1362,5,READ HARRY POTTER IF TOU STILL HAVEN‚ÄôT,"this is the first time ever that i started reading harry potter and i‚Äôm 19 and i regret that i didn‚Äôt read it earlier, all the books are great so far (i‚Äôm on the 5th book rn) but the first book is amazing and a great way to start the series, it has mind blowing plot twists that will leave you screaming in shock for hours and also teaches a lot of moral values i believe. read it if you haven‚Äôt and i guarantee that you won‚Äôt regret it!"
1363,5,its awesome,awesome book. arrived in perfect condition.exellently written nice suspense e also .I HAVE SEEN ALL THEMOVIES AS WELL AS THEBOOKS.IA WONDER SERIES .HOPE EVERYONE ENJOYS IT.
1364,5,Then thought to buy books (just like meüëª). Buy it,"Worth to buy it. Many of you people firstly saw the movies. Then thought to buy books (just like meüëª). Buy it, you won't regret. The plots & the storyline is little bit different from movie. They includes some extra details, which will makes the book more interesting."

1370,5,A lot of problem!!,"So, this review is not about the book as you wh all know the book is the best one in the world, the problem is that I have paid twice for the kindle unlimited thing but tht is not working. I have used kindle unlimited before and it worked like wind but now i have wasted Rs. 398 and I don't want to waste more. Till now I have  recieved the best service from amazon but this thing is really bugging me. I request everybody that they DO NOT take this kindle unlimited offer for real because most of the bestsellers are not available !!  And I request amazon service to look into the matter"
1371,5,Best fiction book I read,"If you have seen the movie reading the book becomes very effortless. If you are someone like me who struggle to read fiction, this is the best start. Characters and the story flow easily and the writing is racy with no nonsense."
1372,5,harry potter,"This book is packed with all sorts of things ,there's so much magic in it.And simple explanations of all sorts things like quiditch,muggles and all sorts of potions ,charms,spells and magical creatures. if you love fantasy and adventure I would like to reccomend this book to you!!!!!!!"

1377,4,Masterpiece,"It was just awesome, throughout the story you wouldn't be disappointed. Each and everything is so intelligent and precise. I loved it. One star less because of the ending, it didn't left much suspense for the next book and was okaish. But throughout the journey it was amazing"
1378,5,Good read,Harry Potter is a very interesting and exciting book and has hard words. I like it because at certain times Harry can do what other people can‚Äôt do he has the the power of love. The lightning scar on his head was a symbol of love from his mother and that is why he could survive and take Lord Voldemort‚Äôs power.
1379,5,Wow!,"I received this as a gift from a friend because he's heard me say for years that I'd read Harry Potter. Now, that I've read the first one ‚Äî it's simply amazing!"

And boy!! was I suprised! It was simply un-put-downable. I went ahead, and read the first 3 sequels in that tour itself. Thereafter i awaited eagerly to get the next one and the next one after that.It is terribliy unfortunate that i have the non-original prints with me. And the ones i have are pathetic as far as print quality is concerned... so bad that i dare not include it in my collection.To set things right i just ordered the orginal from flipkart. I will reread it and thereafter add it to my prized collection.I cannot recomment it more highly. I think the older you are the better you find it to be...Enjoy being a kid once again!!"

1742,5,Amazingggg,Takes us into world of magic  . Makes us fall in love with characters . Loved it . ......... .
1743,5,Perfect find,Very good but what I must say is that I liked its concept.Very attractive .No words.Excellent and I liked the movie also along with the acting of Harry Potter .
1744,5,Magical,"So I read it for the 16th time as per goodreads and I still do not dare to review it. I mean it's as difficult as measuring your closest friend or any loved one on the parameters of good and bad. Surely they will have both the qualities but you purposefully choose to overlook not so good ones because of the love you have for them. Same is the case with this book, I have lived a life with the boy who lived and the other characters of this series. All these characters are as much my friend (or enemy) as anyone in flesh and blood. Since this book was the beginning of it all, it holds an important place in my little library and heart as well. Probably this is the reason I have 5 different editions of this book :)Right from that ""dull, gray Tuesday when our story starts"" till the time harry decided ""to have a lot of fun with Dudley in summer holidays"" every single line is just perfect; and people who thinks that this is a story for kids or watching the movie is enough well! they couldn't be more wrong. It's been more than a decade since I read it first and still I haven't found any book or series who has as much of impact on me as this one had; and the best thing is that no matter how many times have you read them before you just can't help it to fall in love with JKR's world and characters all over again. She literally has created MAGIC with this and missing something as good as this is a crime."
1745,5,Though I had never read the book as of yet the book was even more intriguing than the movie. Simply amazing and a must read,The book take you into the magical world of Hogwarts.  And thrilling and adventurous the movie is. The book is splended

1845,5,Ms. JK Rowling ‚Äì thank you for weaving magic!,"I fell in love with Harry Potter the first time I read this book ‚Äì some time in 1999, I think. And all that magic surrounding him ‚Äì I just lapped it all up. The characters that pop out of the book and dance in front of one‚Äôs eyes as you read the words is nothing short of amazing ‚Äì I got transported into a different realm. Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, Neville, Dumbledore, Malfoy, Snape and most important of all ‚Äì you-know-who ‚Äì what kind of research and imagination must have come together to create these!  I hated the Dursleys more than Harry did ‚Äì Vernon, Petunia and Dudley. I loved talking to the snake through Harry and felt thrilled when it got its freedom. I got quite excited when Harry found out that he was a wizard and got a chance to go to Hogwarts. I was thrilled with every single adventure that Harry underwent at the tender age of eleven ‚Äì feeling sad for his losses and mistreatment while feeling envious about the magic he was connected to. I hated Snape and Malfoy and wanted to hit out at them on Harry‚Äôs behalf.  Every time Harry lifted his wand to perform a spell, I could feel my right hand twitching. I have lived and breathed Harry Potter and can‚Äôt have enough of him.  The magic spells, Hogwarts' Express, 9 3/4 Platform, the invisibility cloak, the Mirror of Erised, the moving photographs, the magical staircases and corridors, the paintings, the ghosts, parsel-tongue, muggles ‚Äì give me more, please!  How can I forget Quiddich? Such a complicated game and described so clearly and precisely. It was such a thrill when Harry becomes the youngest seeker. I soared on the broom every time Harry took off in it.  I just loved every aspect of the book and each time I read it ‚Äì it takes me a couple of weeks to recover from the fantasy world and get back to normal.  Ms. JK Rowling ‚Äì thank you for weaving magic!"
1846,5,very good,this book is very good . this book is very intresting and has many excellent  charechters . this is the best book i have ever read  it is exelent
1847,4,Wonderful,"Awesome book, great story and even better writing style.I would recommend it to everyone , wether they are children or adults."

I sometimes really wondered whether there really was a Hogworts.The writer's description was also very impressive ; just a little bit of imagination and you find yourself in a world of magic. It makes me wish that it was true. That witches and wizards truly exist , that I'm one of them. But alas, no. In this story I envy Harry greatly.On the whole, this a truly fascinating book. And not to forget that this is just the beginning of an extraordinary adventure. You will be completely in love with the characters of this book by the time you finish readind the series.

2037,5,Ok,The book is really good.. I would love to buy the next part. üòçüòÑ
2038,5,Harry Potter #1,"This was a repurchase for me as my original Harry Potter book is battered from years of reading. I've reread this book since and of course, I loved it. The beginning can be a little slow for younger readers as a lot of it is not in the movies, but the remaining 85% is and can be completely imagined throughout. I like the fact most of the original dialogue was translated into movies which is something I've noticed since rereading as an adult. Lovely start to the fabulous series and I am buying the full set to have a newer looking set on my shelf!The artwork on the cover is so much better than the original book which is red. There are illustrations around the chapter headings too which adds a special something. The paper in this book is a lot firmer and of better quality. It's bigger in length than my original one by about 100 pages but that's probably just a printing difference. There isn't anything additional. I think there was a map in the front of mine but I 'm unsure.Fab read of course."
2039,5,Review H.P. ?  -  I can't do that!,"My Granddaughter has been asking me for my copy of Harry Potter Book 1, but I know my daughter only too well and I know if my copy goes to their house, in all likelihood it won't be back into mine, hence the purchase! I'm sure H.P. doesn't need a review by me, just to say that children need magic in their lives, as do we all really, and H.P. surely satisfies that need. I know too that J.K. Rowling originally intended that the books would be read by the same age children as Harry is in the book - Book 1 aged 10-11 and so on. (does a Grandma of %# years count?)My Granddaughter is 8yrs old but her 12 year old cousin has read all bar books 6 &7 and she thinks she can too. I'm sure if she finds them hard to understand then she will stop reading them. I'm happy she's reading, she's happy to read H.P. & the Philosophers Stone. All is well!"
2040,5,"Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone, Kindle Copy","So, as a blind person, I've got both narrations of the Harry Potter books so why spend money on the Kindle copies?  Well, I think the answer to that is that I just love returning to join Harry and his friends in the wizarding world and with having access to Kindle through Alexa I felt I might as well go right ahead and purchase them on Kindle.I just love this book right from the start and even though it isn't as exciting and edge of your seat as the other books are, yet there is that excitement you feel along with Harry in Chapter 4 when Hagrid turns up in the shack during the storm to give him the good news and I don't think any Harry Potter fan could ever fail to feel the excitement along with Harry as he and Hagrid go to Diagon Alley and he buys his books and other material he'll need for his time at Hogwarts.  I love it when his vault at Gringots is opened and he sees all the money his parents have left him.  I love the background we get to the Dursleys in the first chapter and the description of the day which eventually leads to his arrival at Privet Drive.  As we read this book, we need to be aware how little Harry knows and we get an idea of how he's feeling as he awaits his sorting on his arrival at the school.  As the Dursleys fight a losing battle when the letters start coming (and increasing with each delivery, ending with about a hundred at the hotel, you just know that, even though they're eventually in a place where Uncle Vernon's certain they won't be disturbed, that by hook or by crook Dumbledore will eventually get him to Hogwarts.  As he tells Mrs Cole in Book 6, they'll be taking Tom Riddle away whatever.  So Harry begins this roller coaster adventure throughout the seven books and he will not only need his friends but all the magical training he can get, especially in Defence against the dark arts which will be important as he must face the wizard who has not only attempted to kill him but has eluded capture by the Ministry of Magic."
2041,5,Worth the Wait,"i always knew this book would be one I loved, but for some reason never read it.  So it was one of those books I ended up knowing about, and saw the movie for but hadn't read.Finally I got around to read it and found it was far better than I imagined. Completely different to the impression I had in my head about it.I am so late to the party there is little I can say about it, but if you are like me and still at the thinking about it stage then buy this book and you wont be disappointed."
2042,4,Very interesting book,"I really liked this book. It's about a boy who lives in a broom cupboard at his uncle's house and who hilariously ends up at a wizard-school!.. you can't make this up. It's full of weird terms and magical jargon which makes it sometimes hard to read. Yet it has a nice plot. But i'm not going to spoil more of the story here - read it yourself.They should make a movie about this! In fact, the story lends itself very well for a sequel."
2043,4,glad I've got round to it.,"As a 50 something I'm probably not the target audience especial having managed to not read any of the books or see any of the films to date. I've no idea what prompted me to download  a copy, but I'm pleased I did, also pleased I wasn't doing it for 'O' Level as that would have ruined the enjoyment. Some of it was predictable, but hat could be because it is so well known bits of it are subconscious back ground information, some what like reading the original Dracula and in equal measures the same way it had unexpected twists. Not so riveting I couldn't put it down I stopped halfway through to re-read a book that turned up in the post, even then I read it in a little over a week in 4 or 5 sessions, and I guess the fact that I then down loaded the chamber of secrets means I'm hooked"
2044,4,Good Condition/packing - Has Pictures But Only A Few.,This Book Came In Great Condition And Is Always A Good Series To Read. I Was However Under The Impression It Was A Picture Book That Had Alot Of Pictures Threw out The Book But Besides from that This is a great book and seller to by from. Ive Attached Some Pictures To Give You An Idea Of What The Book Looks Like Outside And In.
2045,5,Un libro fantastico!,"Questo √® stato il mio primo libro in lingua straniera e, appunto, l'ho comprato per migliorare il mio inglese. Anche se il mio inglese non √® perfetto, non ho trovato enormi difficolt√† nella comprensione del testo. Infatti, √® scritto in un inglese davvero semplice. Consiglio questo libro a chiunque voglia iniziare a leggere in lingua straniera, ma anche ai fan di Harry Potter che desiderano leggerlo in lingua originale!"
2046,5,5 Stars *****,"This book is a fabulous start to the series, and it got me really hooked! The story is about a young boy named Harry, whose wizard parents died after an evil wizard killed them. Unbeknown to Harry he was going to be a wizard as after the death of his parents he lived with his aunt and uncle, the meanest people who you could imagine, the opposite to his parents. This book tells you about his magical adventures at Hogwarts, a school for witches and wizards.I loved this book as it makes you imagine what it would be like to have that experience of being at Hogwarts, it really takes you away into a magical world. The highlight for me was the fantastic setting of Hogwarts, it seemed so real but as I‚Äôve now seen the film it was an even clearer picture. The only negative point for me about this book was that I couldn‚Äôt put it down! The great thing about the book is it allows children to escape into a new world of magic and adventure . I would recommend this book to people aged 9 - 99!I guarantee it will take you into a magical world."
2047,5,Best Book for Children and Adults.,"Bought Philosophers Stone for my young cousin  it obviously I've read and reread it myself over the years. Shes 8 this year and reading is her absolute favourite thing so I thought this would be a good time to introduce HP. I cannot recommend the book enough for adults and children alike. It's a great book to get children interested in other books, even if you read them this and they start to read the others themselves. Just don't let them watch the films first - the books are so much better!"
2048,4,Better than the movie......mostly.,"It seems just about everyone I know has read this series. Having watched the movies and finding them enjoyable if slightly frustrating I decided it was time to dive in to the books. Though brief (finished this first book in one sitting) it did seemingly  cast a little bit of magic on me. I did feel some of the world building was a little on the light side, but reminded myself that as a child friendly read much more would have possibly put the original target audience off. I look forward to picking up the next book in the series."
2049,5,"The most loved, magical book you could ever read!","I've read this series to my son so many times (he's a huge HP fan just like me!) I love how the friendship between Harry, Hermione and Ron grows throughout the series and the magical adventure they take us on. There are a lot of interesting and fun characters to meet throughout the story and we all need a Dumbledore in our life. Hogwarts is a school that everyone wants to attend. This book has everything, a fabulous plot, intriguing characters, a world full of magic and a whole lot of excitement that will have you binge reading ... a must read for all ages!"
2050,4,"Perfeito estado, mas entrega levou uma eternidade","Mesmo comprando no dia 4 de julho e recebendo s√≥ dia 30 (MEU DEUS), o livro chegou em perfeito estado, sem amassados, sem dobras. O livro √© super bonito e vem com uma jacket sensacional (aquela capinha que envolve o livro e que d√° pra tirar). A capa √© mais bonita ainda; a lombada √© de um tecido show e o restante da capa √© texturizado em losangos. Muito top esse livro, pena que levou uma eternidade pra chegar, primeira vez que a entrega foi uma porcaria pela Amazon. Mas enfim, o livro est√° aqui em perfeito estado."
2051,5,Its Potter .... if you dont know by now .... I am not sure what else to say,Quality story which I am now sharing with my 9 year old. He loves every moment of this book.JKR is a legend .. cant wait to buy the rest for himPrint quality and book binding is great. I am looking at the illustrated ones also. Buy with confidence.
2052,5,Harry Potter is not jusy sweets and games!!!,I give this book five out of five.I am reading chapter twentie from the Prison of Azkaban and its really good.I recomend Hary Potter and the Chamber of secrets if you like dramtic books.This book is fine even better than the film.I like the part when Hermione steps into the fires and disappears.My friend says he is reading this book and he says that he read only to chapter twelve!I read faster than he did!He even started ealer than me but I read two books faster when he started a month before I did cause I couldn't stop reading even when I had to play my piano I puted the book next to me and after started to read!XD LOL BEST EVER BOOK.+_+ ;~;
2053,4,First time,This is the first time I have read this book. My Mother was always nagging me to read it. So I have now read it as an adult. It was better than I thought although the first half was better than the last. But the detention chapter just didn 't make sense as I would have never happened. Will I read the rest.... I might just to please my Mum even though she isn't with us anymore.
2054,5,Modern classics of fantasy storytelling,"As a teenager growing up around the same age as Harry Potter did in the films (when each of them came out), I found the stories both in the films and books (once I got round to reading them) highly imaginative, relatable in many ways and compelling reading. The books of course have a great deal more story and background information than the films could ever include, which makes the books even more enjoyable to read again and again. Like the characters, the books mature over the series and change from being predominantly for children to young adults; but the popularity of these books have shown how they can be enjoyed by people of all ages."
2055,5,A different experience,"I was really looking forward to listening to the cassette tapes of the first book .... and I‚Äôll say I was not disappointed. These were really cool to listen üéß to. I enjoyed them so much I also bought the Chamber of Secrets, however it is hard to get a hold of any others but I will still be searching."
2056,5,Year 5 review - submitted by teacher,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is an amazing book about three friends (Harry, Ron and Hermione) who travel to Hogwarts School for witches and wizardry in a train station that you can't even see! J.K.Rowling is definitely magical herself, winning double smarties award!  But the happiness twists around to evil.  Harry must adventure into the dungeons of the school before He-who-must-not-be-named does and gets the stone for something priceless... I absolutely love this book and I recommend it for kids who love magic.Review by Eva, aged 10"
2057,5,Good books,"I am not a person who reads. Infact I've only read 4 books in my life. I usually read one paragraph and the books not picked up again. However, I got the 7 books in sale and so far I am half way through the 3rd book now. When once you pick the book up, you don't want to put it down"
2058,5,Magical journeys with Stephen Fry!,"Was recommended this for long journeys with kids, and my what a fantastic idea.We‚Äôre all engrossed in Stephen Fry‚Äôs beautiful voice telling this wonderful story.Don‚Äôt feel the journeys go ( there‚Äôs no more fighting in the back üòâ)I you need to drive long distance with kids ( but adult kids too) this is a must!"
2059,5,A Great Children's Book Which I Sure Will Be A Classic,I think I was about 23 when this first came out. There was a lot of hype about it and I got the chance to scan the first few pages of somebody else's book and saw it as a children's book and it wasn't for me.Some years later on I've got children of my own. They're nearly seven and although they're not quite of the ability to read it themselves I read it to them at bed time and they love it. We just read a few pages every night and stop at a point that leaves them inquisitive as to what happens next.It's not comparable to Tolkien or Pratchett and I don't think it's supposed to be. It's a simple 200 page children's book about a little boy who is a wizard and goes to wizard school.My children love it. I've heard it gets a bit more sinister as the series goes on but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. This first one is exciting and involving for them and only occasionally does a word need explaining to them.If J. K. Rowling is heralded as the new Enid Blighton I think is rightly so. I think she written something that captures children's imagination and encourage a generation to read books and that's no bad thing.
2060,5,a touch of nostalgia to treasure,"Way back when we started to read Harry Potter to our children, the first book being borrowed from the Library without knowing a huge amount about it.  We were hooked from page one and over the years it became somewhat of an event for the whole family eagerly awaiting the next book in the series to read about the magical world of Harry Potter and his chums.  The books are so much better than the films and highly recommended even if you have seen the films.  Particularly, the early books that were somewhat less dark and a bit more fun.  The level of detail that goes into making this parallel world believeable is the biggest talent of all for J K Rowling.  What a mind to have been able to think up the rules of Quidditch and all of the wonderful spells.  My daughter was seven with the original Library copy of the Philospher's Stone, we took turns in reading a page each.  My secret was that I used to leave her room at night only to go to bed and read on alone as I could not wait to see what happened next!  So back to present day and a gift for a rather cool teenager, what better than the hardback version of the only book in the series that we did not actually own a copy of.  Amongst all the designer clothes, CD's and perfume in the Christmas stocking this bought the biggest smile along with the Harry Potter Lego!  The timeless Mr Potter brings out the inner child in all of us."
2061,5,Harry is no normal boy... HE'S A WIZARD!,"Harry Potter and the philosophers stone.By JK RowlingAn amazing tale of a boy, Harry Potter. He lives in a house with his nasty auntie, uncle and cousin. Harry is no normal boy... HE'S A WIZARD!This is a story about his first year at his new school with his two new friends. Learning spectacular spells, how to make potions and coming face to face with his immortal enemy.I really loved this book, it was amazing."
2062,5,Perfect read for 8 year old,Purchased for daughters birthday. She has watched the films and now wanted to read the books! So she decided to purchase this with her birthday money. Fantastic read for an 8 year old and her comment is it‚Äôs much better than the film as the film missed too much out! Great for ages 8+
2063,5,"I really recommend  it  to everybody, doesn't matter how old you are!!","As always amazon delivered the item on time, great service!!I'm 26 and I never though of reading Harry Potter, then recently i watched an interview with J.K.Rowling and with my surprise she explained how hard  her life was before becoming so famous. Then she spoke about Harry with so much passion as a mother would talk about her child. So I though that even though I am a bit old for this kind of reading I would give it a try. Well reading the book I felt as the characters were almost real, they surely are for Mrs. Rowling and she couldn't have written this book better. I was totally hooked. I really recommend  it  to everybody, doesn't matter how old you are!!"
2064,5,Love the covers!,"Having bought this for my elder son, I found myself buying them again for my younger sons 10th birthday so that he had his own copy.  The cover is much updated and has a lovely feel to it.  Yes, that does sound as strange as it reads but I do judge a cover on its design and feel.  He hasn't read it or the others (I bought the first 3) but was delighted to have his own copies.  Based on the first 3 books I think I will buy the remaining books for his Christmas so that he has the full set in this design."
2065,4,Good read,"Wasn‚Äôt sure would be my sort book. But read in few days, enjoyable, will probably try book 2. I used to only read biographies but started reading crime novels. Tried Harry Potter because so popular and reviews high wide age group."
2066,5,After all this time? ..... Always.,"I'm in my twenties and Harry Potter has been my favourite story for as long as I can remember. Being a huge potter-head, I decided to buy the children's edition, as it has larger font and each chapter is decorated with stars. They also feature a map of Hogwarts, drawn in an illustrative style, which adds more charm to it.High quality paper and lovely matter cover with bright gold lettering.Excellent read for kids and adults alike!Thank you JK Rowling for making my childhood magical."
2067,5,Quality as described,I have ordered a few pre-owned books from various places and have had a few disappointments when it comes to quality - even when something has been sold as good or very good. This book I received was excellent quality so I am very pleased
2068,5,"Brilliant, according to my grandson","My seven year old grandson gallops through Tom Gates, Billy Bonkers, Dirty Bertie and Astrosaurs books.Wanting to stretch him a bit and after discussion with his mother, started him on David Walliams and he has devoured the whole lot.After further discussions, I got this for him and....he galloped through it, although he did have to ask for help with a small number of words and concepts - he tells me it is brilliant.HP 2 is on order and, when we have finished the HP series, I suppose it will have to be Dostoevsky, Zola or Kafka."
2069,4,All the discs are there.,"I needed this as all the tapes are well worn and have started to tangle in the tape machine.  So as I have a great granddaughter who will be brought up on Elvis and Harry Potter. By the way, the price was ¬£21.79 but I was charged ¬£27.79."
2070,5,Excellent book at a bargain price!,I bought this book for my son to read for world book day as he loved all the films and hes getting a lot better with his reading now (hes nearly 7).  This book is really nice it is a good size for my son to carry around with him and been paperback its not too heavy for him and the text is a nice readable size for him.  I think the price for this book is excellent and I would have expected it to cost more than it did.  I am sure I will be back to purchase the next book in the series for him once hes completed reading this once.  would recommend to others.
2071,5,Harry Potter!,It's a really good book and for all those that have watched the harry potter films the book is soo good. Quality: good. I recommend paperback as it allows you to read it flexibly but it does place a few creases in the stem.  The plot is very good but even though JK Rowling wrote the original she left out and did a different line then in the movies for example: she says and I quote 'Harry- your a wizard though one of my favourite lines is 'You're a Wizard Harry along with doing the same with Emma Watson and Rupert Girnt's favourite line. She does not put a lot of description but the book is still great.
2072,5,Fantastic,"I first read this when it came out, and have thoroughly enjoyed revisiting it again. I've watched the movies many times, which left chunks out and altered  some things, so re-reading this has been fantastic."
2073,5,Books and film on equal ratings.,"I am now around 3/4 of the way through the book and it is as good as I hoped it would be. Having watched all the movies I wanted to read the books to just pad out the storylines a bit more, as I know it is impossible to put every detail into a film. The films have kept to the main element of the book and I hope all the rest will be as good."
2074,4,It starts‚Ä¶,"This has been on my list for so long. I wish I had read it when I was younger but it didn‚Äôt disappoint. ‚ÄòRoald Dalh-esque‚Äô to start with, with the superhuman child and cruel carers, but you can see the Hogwarts world start to grow. Now for the rest of the series! Looking forward to it‚Ä¶"
2075,5,Good book,"What to say about this book that hasn‚Äôt been said before? The pages felt really nice in my fingers and it had that nice new book glue smell (my inner Charlie Kelly was very happy indeed). Great choice of font, was very easy to read, and the spaces between the letters were very satisfying. The cover was smooth and soft, and the whole book was manufactured to a high standard which I was very impressed with. I liked the pictures on the front, they were nice. Good size book, fit nicely in my bag. Would recommend to a friend"
2076,5,I feel like I've missed out on something so important that only ...,"I've never read the Harry Potter series as a Child. I know, what a crime! I feel like I've missed out on something so important that only kids who've read the books can understand. I am now 23 years old and have just started reading the books (I was always a massive fan of the movies). I feel like I've been let in on this wonderful secret, and it's amazing! It really does open your imagination, even as an adult. I'm delighted that I decided to read the first one, and I'm so happy that 7 books exist, because I sense a magical summer is ahead of me."
2077,5,Perfect,"My daughter as recently got my Harry Potter books out to read and we didn't have the first one, it's gone missing somewhere! So I said I'd buy her the first one, I love the new child friendly picture on the cover! Harry Potter doesn't disappoint so I'm sure my daughter will love reading them"
2078,5,Thrilled with these books!,"This set of books came in a lovely box to keep them all together. Each book cover is in a soft, mat finish, which is enjoyable to hold and nicely illustrated. I adore this set of Harry Potter books. A forever treasure!"
2079,5,Great read and exciting throughout. Highly recommended.,My first Harry Potter book. Absolutely fascinating and exciting throughout. What an imagination the author has. Cannot wait to read the next one in the series. Highly recommended.
2080,5,The best book EVER!!!,This book is absolutely AMAZZZZZZZZIIIIIIINNNNNGGGGGGGGGG! I so recommend this book. Also this is just book if you hate or if you love it rememeber its just a book...  and some peoples whole lives.-Daisy
2081,5,MAGICAL,"Harry Potter will live on for generations, it's like Mary Poppins. That little bit of magic that we all wish we could do to make everything that little bit better. A really feel good book and film appeals to all ages and I'm 64"
2082,5,Best book ever,I love Harry Potter. I‚Äôm his biggest fan in the whole wide world.I would highly recommend reading this book.  I guarantee if you like a touch of drama you should read it and you‚Äôll love it.
2083,5,Recommend,Daughter is harry potter crazy at minute...watched all the films over Easter now we are reading the books. Reasonably priced and fast delivery. Plan to buy rest of books
2084,5,Amazing,"Once again re-reading this book never becomes dull, with all its excitement and wonder. It makes me proud to have grown up in the years that I did as I got to follow the amazing story of Harry Potter. I still get the exact same feelings now as I did when I first read the books and watch the films. I recommend this book to everyone, I promise as soon as you pick it up you won‚Äôt want to put it down."
2085,5,Big fan!,"When I read these books for the first time, I was 11 and borrowed them from a friend.Been a huge fan since and decided to re-read them in the original langauge, but my budget didnt allow for me to buy the set as it was too expensive, so it was great that i could get books with such beautiful covers, and buy them 3 at a time so I could be within my budget but still get some reading done.The books are A MUST READ"
2086,5,MAGICAL AND AMAZING,Harry Potter is an amazing read full of adventures fun and of course magic.This book is enchanted!It has a super storyline and is packed with cliffhangers.I give this book a five star rating a and thumbs up.I recommend this book for children aged 8+.I absolutely adored this fantastic book and I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I did! Good reading!(:
2087,5,First proper book for granddaughter.,Bought this book as my granddaughter's first proper book and she is loving it. We will be buying her the rest of the series as she finishes each book.
2088,4,Great reading,"i bought this for my 12 year old Granddaughter and im pleased to say she enjoyed reading it, She is not the best of readers at the moment but this book seemed a good way to get her interested in reading and books, she hasnt asked for the other books in the series yet but im sure once she has read another she will be hooked, so maybe another one for her birthday then one for Christmas"
2089,5,THE FIRST BOOK IN THE MOST MAGICAL SERIES EVER WRITTEN!,"HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE is the first book in the HARRY POTTER series, which are in my opinion the best books ever written. This one, funny, dark and very clever, begins Harry's journey and introduces many brilliant, original and memorable characters. The storyline was so gripping and engaging that i read the book in just a few days. It is reasonably short (unlike the other ones which are just as good if not better) so young children wont get bored, but even if it was over 1,000 pages i would never get bored. Everyone has heard of this series and most people love these books, and this one is the one that started it all. A magical book! ENCHANTING! 10/10!"
2090,5,Happy as a Hogwart,"There's almost no point reviewing this as pretty much everyone knows all there is to know, but my seven-year-old is reading it avidly and loving every minute!"
2091,5,Harry Potter children's books.,"Bought the first four of seven books for grandson's 8th birthday, he'd been borrowing from our boxed set which were not really suitable for him, small print size etc... He's thrilled to bits to have his own books and we'll complete the set for him!He loves everything Harry Potter. Books are suitable for his age group and upwards. These are good paperback copies, recommend them."
2092,3,I would not buy it,"All in all a good story well written, however the use of the word 'fat' in a hateful way put me off and I won't continue to read the series. This is a very lazy prop for literature"
2093,4,Great read,"9 year old loving the story have the first two will buy the rest when she finishes the others, helpfull as now with the home schooling i want to keep her interest in her reading"
2094,4,Excellent way to not support Joanna Kathleen,"This book was perfect, the price was astounding and the book had so little damage that honestly it should be 5 times more expensive. I bought this since I originally read the series on my kindle, and now I want them on my shelves! If you're looking for ways to support trans rights but still love Harry Potter, stick it to the man and buy second hand, take that she-who-must-not-be-named."
2095,5,Stunning Soo extra,"Completely Stunning ! I can‚Äôt say enough how beautiful these versions are. The regular illustrated versions are very lovely too and actually are enough to appreciate Jim Kay‚Äôs  fantastic work! But If you are a Potterhead / collector then do not sit on this , you won‚Äôt regret it."
2096,5,Love it!,"Brilliant service, book is in mint condition. No scuffs, marks or creases.Very happyGreat gift for anyone who loves Harry potter"
2097,5,Outstanding.,This book is worth every penny. I bought all 4 of them and they are up there with my most prized possessions. Absolutely outstanding. Amazing.
2098,5,A good start,"I'm so glad I was into reading books before I saw,the film of this. I can remember buying the books. 're reading them now is just as much fun"
2099,5,Awesome!,"This was the first time I read a Harry Potter book and I absolutely loved it!Harry Potter, at the age of 11, finds out that he has been chosen to join Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn magical skills.Will he make friends and conquer the Dark Lord (who killed Harry's parents)? Or will he die?Although I have re-read the book several times (can't count how many times), I still enjoy reading it!A must - read for 7 yr olds and up.- Review by an 8 yr old"
2100,5,Magical,"I read this book went it was first published it is amazing.Just purchased the paperback for my 6 year old granddaughter who loves it. She reads it to her mum every bedtime. Magical,  I had forgotten how good it is."
2101,5,Your never to old,"I‚Äôm 44 and thought I‚Äôm maybe to old for the Harry potters books but thought I would try them, I couldn‚Äôt put them down! Ordered them all second hand but all arrived brand new.Just goes to show your never to old"
2102,5,one of my favorite series,i love the Harry potter series because they are full of details and information throughout the series . but my favorite part is the sorting hat's song . and my second favorite part is when harry and ron meet Hermione Granger and my third and final favorite part is the match . my least favorite part is when they see the three headed dog . a spectacular awesome book written by J.K Rowling.
2103,5,A perfect birthday gift for my granddaughter,My granddaughter has just got into Harry Potter so this was the perfect gift for he birthday. We can now discuss it as I read it years ago.
2104,5,Timeless classic,"Actually enjoyed it more reading it with my daughter as an adult than I remember or thought I would! Literally best book ever to read as a family with children from the age of 5,6 which they will then want to read independently from 7,8. Just loved the whole experience!"
2105,5,Spec-tacular,One of the only book series every child should read at school. Great quality covet and fine clear print that makes it easier to read üëå
2106,5,words and imagination only needed to relive the charm and excitement of the movie,A lovely read. Have been meaning to get around to reading the Harry Potter books for years having watched the films when my children were younger. Reading the book relived the familiar characters and plots but with added charm of merely great writing and my imagination. Looking forward to moving on to the second book.
2107,5,"It's used, it can be seen. But it was used with love.","It came looking like someone enjoyed reading it a thousand times. But that's what gives it the look of a book that made a journey and took the readers with it.The seller gathers books and resells them in order to make a difference, that's why I think this purchase is perfect!"
2108,4,Amazingly written,"It is amazingly written, j.k. Rowling is very talented and I can't believe she made up part of this story in a train on a tissueüòØüòÑ. There are a few bad words in this book but its fine altogether"
2109,5,The book arrived in perfect condition. Must say that the gold stuffs do ...,"My little sisters is now an official HP fan. The book arrived in perfect condition. Must say that the gold stuffs do fade over time, especially if you read the book many times."
2110,5,I jove this,Amzin stoey 1 off my faverts i jove the story and the carters its jik a story that can tak you in to a mor magkil wold
2111,5,Cant wait for him to love as much as his dad and I did,Gift for my 7 year old grandson.  His first foray into grown up books so chose the children's cover.  Cant wait for him to love as much as his dad and I did .  Thank you
2112,2,Hasn't stood the test of time.,"Unlike Lord of the Rings and many other real fantasy classics (from which the author has stolen many of her ideas), this does not hold up to modern scrutiny. Boring, over-padded chapters - huge chips on shoulders at every turn. It will remain a 'classic' to Potterheads, but if you want an up to date version, and a fun, fast-moving read, then try Barry Potter: Phil Osafa's Stoned."
2113,5,Great book.,"Amazing! Deffinately not just for kids, i really enjoyed reading this book. Fast delivery as well so i was pleased."
2114,5,Cheapest place to buy,"This is the cheapest place I've seen this book, I read these as a child and have bought this for my son to enjoy, I absolutely love the new cover art on these too"
2115,5,"Great book, a lot more interesting detail than the movies which was cool","Got this a while back and decided to read it when the internet was down, not a big fan of reading but I enjoyed it. It was nice to have more depth than the movies have."
2116,5,A must read for kids and adults,"Wonderful book for Child and adult alike. I first met Harry Potter when this book was originally published, so long before the hype that surrounded JK Rowling from the second book onwards. I was immediately drawn into the wonderful world of Hogwarts and beyond and marvelled at the way the book appealed to both adults and children. I have introduced many of my nieces and nephews to Harry, Ron and Hermione and have bought this book for the youngest nephew who recently expressed the excitement of wanting to read it. I envy him that he is embarking upon this magical journey but will enjoy watching him do so! Next for induction the great nephews and nieces."
2117,5,beautiful. amazing. magical. EVERYONE must read.,"i literally cannot put into words how much i value these books. they literally mean the world to me, and EVERYONE needs to read them. everyone knows Harry Potter but the books tell a different story from the films (not literally, just figuratively, although some little bits are different (better in the book)). they honestly changed my life. PLUS this new edition is BEAUTIFUL i have 3 Harry Potter box sets but these ones are the most aesthetically pleasing. WOW"
2118,5,The Philosopher's Stone,I read this to understand the fascination with Harry Potter.  I can see that it would be exciting for children but why adults read it beats me!
2119,5,What a beautiful edition! I already have the original editions that ...,What a beautiful edition! I already have the original editions that were printed but when they announced the new covers I knew I had to add them to my collection. The story itself is addictive and engrossing as you so through the series and the detail j k writes in makes you almost believe that this world could be real and in a way she makes it so that kids and adults alike can relate to. I doubt you will read this and not fall in love with it. Happy reading!!
2120,5,"Just read this again after 20 years, still brilliant!","One of my all time favourites, Bought it as an ebook as unfortunatly I lost my hard copy, still an enjoyable read after 20 years!"
2121,5,Off to Hogwarts,"One of the best stories of all time, absolutely love it. Great start to Harry Potter books. Highly recommended."
2122,5,We are really enjoying them and they get better with each book,Read this with my grandson in the summer subsequently bought the rest of the set. We are really enjoying them and they get better with each book.
2123,5,Perfect bedtime stories.,Good book. I used to have the whole collection from my childhood.. But lost one along the way. This completes my collection and my 9year old is not enjoying them at bedtime just as much as I did :) Arrived in good condition.
2124,5,A classic,"You're never too old to read Harry Potter. One of my all time favourite books, and a classic for a reason."
2125,5,Breathtaking,This book is outstandin. Read this when I was younger but wanted to re-read. The art work is breathtaking.
2126,5,1st Harry Potter book.,This is a great read for children and adults. I've read it twice and the world of Harry Potter is still as exciting. J.K.Rowling creates a brilliant atmospheric  pararell  world . Would recommend her Harry Potter books to anyone with imagination and who enjoys escapism .
2127,5,Read it ASAP,"Nothing much to say about Harry Potter since everybody and their mother knows what it is. If you have seen the movies but have not read the books, then I suggest that you do, since you are missing out!This new versions texture of the book feels so good to hold too.Pleasant read 5/5!"
2128,5,Excellent,Great series what more can you say. This was a re-read right through the whole series one after the other and then the Cursed Child as well. Excellent!!
2129,5,I loved it. Great for ling journeys in the car.,"I have nor read read any Harry Potter books or seen any of the films, so I wasn't sure if I would like this audio book. I found the 1st 30-40 mins a bit puzzling, but by the end of the 1st CD I was gripped, waiting to hear what was about to happen.I loved Steven Fry reading it."
2130,5,Great,Re-reading it....just as amazing as it was when i read it (i am the 1st generation potterhead lol)
2131,5,Good quality and great value for money,The book is great we all know Harry Potter. So I'll just say the book materially is nice and sturdy and I can't believe is that cheap.
2132,5,Watched the films a number of times and love them. Reading the books I thought I knew ...,"Watched the films a number of times and love them. Reading the books I thought I knew what would be coming, yet a lot of the film had bits missing over the books. In fact it makes the story a lot clearer!I"
2133,5,Must read,"Fantastic story and great value for money, fast delivery and the book arrived in excellent condition"
2134,5,saving grace when in hospital,"Great story,had read before and decided to have a read a thon when I was in hospital.Pleased to say it cheered me up and distracted well by story"
2135,5,Jo does a marvellous job of crafting an intricate story that sets a great ground for the rest of the series,"I pre-ordered this book in early August, eagerly anticipating September 1st when it would arrive on my doorstep. Low and behold, it arrived mid-afternoon is the standard Amazon cardboard packaging. Now, to say I'm a Harry Potter fan would be an understatement, so this was definitely a treat.The content is exactly the same as any other edition of Philosopher's Stone, which in itself is a magical story for all ages that follows a young, orphaned boy as he discovers that he is a wizard and attends his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry whilst forming lasting friendships and coming face-to-face with the very person who killed his parents. Jo does a marvellous job of crafting an intricate story that sets a great ground for the rest of the series.John Duddle does a fantastic job of the new artwork which brings a new face to the British version of the books, but in my opinion, the American covers by Kazu Kibuishi, published my Scholastic are a little bit nicer.Overall, this is a great book for all ages that introduces you to the magical world of Harry Potter that will leave you enchanted by the wizarding world."
2136,5,Love this,It should be law that everyone should read Harry Potter.The start of an amazing series of books.
2137,5,Great Read,Loved the Harry Potter Books - In my 30s and first time reading. Every child should read and get lost in the world of magic!

2140,5,Life changing,Best book series in the world. You will smile laugh and cry and gasp along with it and be invested in each character. The story will live with you forever.

2142,5,Love it,This is amazing. Love it. Great adventure. Who doesn‚Äôt love a Harry Potter book. Especially the first 3.
2143,5,Perfect present for children,"Present for 10 year old that just started reading them. He loved the books, just as I thought he would"
2144,5,Brilliant books,I really enjoyed all the Harry Potter books. I switched the films first which is probably the wrong way round but the books filled in a lot of gaps for me. I downloaded these to my kindle and read them on holiday it was brilliant.
2145,5,Bought for my grandson to read and get submerged into Potter life!,"Good book, so well written, to start my grandson on his Potter journey!"

2149,5,LOVE HARRY P !!!,"After reading the book a few years ago I wanted to refresh my memory of it all ... and when commuting to work not always viable to have a big book - so I was able to transfer the Cd's to my iPod and now can listen to my hearts content.Stephen Fry is the best person they could possibly have chosen to read the books, as his interpretation of the characters are great and he reads with such passion !Am hoping I can gather all the audio's books of the series - as they are great value for money too !"
2150,5,Classic,Harry Potter is of course a classic.This was purchased for my 7 year old for her birthday after she's pestered me for months to read mine (which are very well read and fragile)The new illustrations on the covers are absolutely stunning.

2152,5,Libro fantastico per grandi e piccini,"Ho deciso di comprare questo libro per cercare di migliorare il mio inglese.J.K. Rowling scrive davvero molto bene, √® un inglese facilmente comprensibile (nel mio caso non tutte le parole riconosco ma √® facile intuire il significato dal contesto).Inoltre la copertina ha una illustrazione fantastica, me ne sono innamorato !!"
2153,5,A must-read,"Being 45 years old, it was a surprise how much I enjoyed this book.  If I had these book in my chilhood!"
2154,5,What an adventure,"The first story where the world meets Harry Potter. This was the 3rd time reading the story after many years. There were so many things that I picked up in the story that I did not pick up the first time through! Haggrid‚Äôs motorcycle was Sirus‚Äôs?  What an adventure.  From the very first chapter J K R leads you into the wizard world. For those of you reading this series for the first time, I am jealous. Enjoy"

2160,4,Anyone for Potter,Punctual delivery. I don't like the book. The style of writing is hit & miss. My boy likes it when I read it with him though. So that's all that matters.
2161,5,Perfect,Exactly as described! The cover is stunning also!

2164,5,Magic,I thought that this story was so well written it was a job to put it down.
2165,5,great introduction to the Harry Potter story,"Well written, allows the imagination to work, stands alone as a story or as as part of a series"

2173,5,Great read,Bought for my son to see how he got on with reading it as the films a slightly different.
2174,5,A terrific storybook for kids and OAPs alike.,"I‚Äôve retired this year and at the age of 65, after a very busy career with little time for reading, decided it was about time I discovered the world of Harry Potter. I‚Äôve now read all 7 books. So much better, humorous and more detailed than the films. A great read."
2175,5,Five Stars,I have watched the film a few years ago. but have never read the book. I decided to download it and i was hooked from the first page. the book is 10 times better than the film. to anyone who hasnt read them yet definitely read them.
2176,5,Instant delivery,Bought so that it is on the kindle book and can be read again and again.
2177,5,Harry Potter Luxury,Quick delivery. This book is amazing and well with the money for Harry Potter fans.  The illustrations are fantastic. It even comes in an illustrated Harry Potter cardboard box.

2182,5,When in England...,Muggles. Wizards. Fun. There isn't much to say as it's been reviewed a million times since it first came out in 2001 or so... A very well written book with smart dialogue and themes that will and have appealed to children and adults.
2183,5,Classic jk,Excellent book and great quality
2184,5,great value,read this opening volume years ago in paperback -  now re-read on kindle - still just as enjoyable
2185,5,Listen to the master,Stephen Fry a master of reading this book. I would recommend for HarryPotter fans; 8 hours of engross listening.
2186,5,American buying british versions,So I am american and live on the east coast and I really wanted the British versions of these books since I already own the american ones and I have to say this was the best shipping ever. I got these in five days from ordering them when there was a hurricane going on. Also because I pay things in dollars it was pretty cool that with shipping all of the books cost about 10 us dollars each. which brand new here they would cost 10-16 us dollars so that was really awesome. I can't wait to reread them but have them be authentic :)
2187,5,Brilliant narration from Stephen Fry. Great for long car journeys.,Next packaging of seven CDs. Does not get better than Stephen Fry as a narrator. Surely he's the best there is.
2188,5,An excellent tale,I have read this previously and sent the film. Just wanted to catch up with old friends and remind myself of brilliant read.
2189,5,Great book,Order for my son (22) üòÇ who is enjoying it

2198,5,Harry Potter you can‚Äôt go wrong with thatReally enjoyed the book,Harry Potter you can‚Äôt go wrong with that
2199,4,Helps passive reader,My 10 year has an aversion towards reading. But this book was incredible. He wants to read it every night in bed. The smaller text makes it a bit difficult to read with night lamp. Otherwise the book is very light weight to carry and even sleep on it‚ò∫Ô∏è

2207,5,Kids reading book,Part of gift set and enjoyed by the kids.
2208,4,A great escape,"This (the first in the series), or any other Harry Potter book for that matter, needs no introduction.  Once you've followed Harry to Hogworts and back during his first term, you'll be coming back for more time and time again!  Its one of those books which you wish will never end - its that magical.  Say what you will about J K Rowling (and lots of people do!), but theres no denying she does write exceedingly good books!"

I'm so glad I finally got around to buying the book, it completely had me hooked, I couldn't put the book down! I've order the rest of the books in the series. I would say that the books are definitely much better than the movies not that the movies are at all bad but the books go into a lot more detail that the films don't include."

2322,5,Brilliant read.,"I purchased this book as part of my collection of Potter books , replacing it for one that I'd lent out and never got back.What more can one say..it's brilliant."
2323,5,Philosophers Stone by JK Rowling,Excellent read and JK Rowling is definitely a great author of this fantasy story..
2324,5,A Classic,"Star Wars, meets Wizards and spells ala Terry Pratchet's earlier works, meets Charlie and the Chocolate Factorty.  Just some of the comparisons I had.  Yes the book is as good as the hype, the kids will love it, if they  can get it off dad first.  The book is beautifully crafed and many aspects  of childhood covered.  The beauty of the book is that you start to wonder  who out in the wide world are ""Muggles"" and who are the magic  beings.  Read the book to find out more.  Beware one taste and you will be  dying for more of young Mr Potter and his wizarding career.  First class,  Rowling is up there with Dahl and Sheppherd, in those classic children  books which are just that little bit more."
2325,4,Great book for a traveling,Picked the book up recently while traveling and really distracted me from the endless car journey that lay in my wait. Loved the story line and would recommend to those who love a good book.

2383,5,Read,Harry Potter is a amazing book for young and old minds tok get you into reading and fantasy. But that is just my opinion
2384,5,Harry Potter,Got finished in two days!
2385,5,Silences kids in cars,If your kids normally argue and fight on car journeys then you should buy this audio book.  Since purchasing and then playing this set of C.D.s we have had two 200 mile journeys in blissful near silence.  The only time they talk is to remind us to put the next disc in.  Stephen Fry reads brilliantly.  I think they are entertained more by this than they are by the films.  Sometime we will have to find the cash for the next set of recordings.  And there is the only down side; they are a bit pricey.  But worth it!
2386,5,Love this book,I am so happy I ordered all the book and they were all in great condition.
2387,4,A great start to a wonderful series,"This is the first time I have read this book and i enjoyed every chapter, while reading i thought it was way better than the film.

2456,5,Harry Potter Book 1 Large Print - What a great idea,"I bought this for my 8 year old son who loves the Harry Potter stories.  Having listened to the stories on cds and got to book 5 with me reading them to him, he decided that he wanted to read the first book himself, but found the tiny print hard going.  This book was the answer for him.  He reads it at school and often, when we go out, he even choses to take this book rather than his DS, which can't be a bad thing!  Well worth the money."

Das Design dieses Buches gef√§llt mir besonders gut und ich bevorzuge es gegen√ºber der normalen ""Kinder"" Version. Das Cover ist schlicht, modern aber mit der sehr sch√∂n detaillierten schwarz-wei√üen Illustration wiederum auch ein Blickfang.Ich empfehle dieses Buch sehr f√ºr Leute die fr√ºher die √úbersetzung gelesen haben, nun aber die Originalversion lesen wollen, und auch f√ºr Leute die nie vorher Harry Potter gelesen haben und B√ºcher in der englischen Sprache bevorzugen."

3025,4,It's a wonderful story that just absorbs you into a world that ...,"The book that introduced us all to the wonders that is Harry Potter. It's a wonderful story that just absorbs you into a world that we could only dream of being a part of. The enchanted version ibooks has is simply stunning and a definite for any collector. The images are gorgeous and really let you become a part of the story.The first story is slower than the others but it's the first book in a long series, we kind of expect that, don't we? Harry and the gang are truly a lovable clang - I love Ron the most and it's not just because we share a birthday. I also find myself loving the dynamics of the character that is Draco Malfoy. He will be a character I know I will grow to love beyond words. I am interested to see who I become more connected too... despite any birthday connections or house connections (considering I am a Slytherin)All in all, a joyous book. One I cannot wait to share with the kids in my life and for generations to come"
3026,5,Five Stars,Great xx
3027,5,Five Stars,Great product!
3028,5,Five Stars,Stephen Fry's reading is superb. 'Nuff said!
3029,5,Consigliatissimo,"E' il secondo che acquisto, questa volta l'ho regalato a un mio caro amico che proprio come me ama Harry Poter.Il libro si presenta molto bene la copertina √® di ottima qualit√† e la stampa dei caratteri al suo interno sono molto nitidi e di facile lettura.Consiglio questo libri a tutti coloro i quali desiderano leggere qualcosa d'inglese per la prima volta in modo tale da imparare nuovi vocaboli e avere pi√π dimestichezza con la lingua. La lettura √® scorrevole e comprensiva non ci vogliono chiss√† quali conoscenze perch√© rimane sempre un libro per ragazzi quindi lo vedo adatto per tutti quelli che hanno un livello di inglese da B1."
3030,5,"La storia non tradisce, l'edizione nemmeno","Dopo quasi dieci anni dalla lettura della traduzione italiana mi sono chiesto 'Perch√© non rileggerlo in versione originale?'Non mi aspettavo che la storia mi coinvolgesse di nuovo cos√¨ tanto, soprattutto per via della lingua, che con mia sorpresa invece non √® stata assolutamente un impedimento. Anzi, durante la lettura ho provato una sensazione di autenticit√† che mi ha permesso di godere la storia ancor di pi√π.Per quanto riguarda l'edizione invece, credo sia perfetta. L'illustrazione in copertina, in particolare, √® stupenda. Cinque stelle meritate tutte!"
3031,5,(Casi) Excelente!,"El libro lleg√≥ muy r√°pido, 1 d√≠a despu√©s de la compra se realiz√≥ el env√≠o, y 1 d√≠a despu√©s lleg√≥ a casa a pesar de ser domingo lo cual valoro bastante.El libro es tal cual la descripci√≥n, pasta gruesa, cubierta de papel con el logo de Harry Potter en dorado y con relieve. Sin embargo la falta de protecci√≥n al libro hizo que esta cubierta llegara levemente maltratado. El libro ven√≠a suelto en una caja protegido √∫nicamente con pl√°stico inflado con aire.Edit: Lo compr√© en 308 pesos, y ahora veo que est√° en m√°s de 400. Excelente trato!ACTUALIZACION: Compr√© la edici√≥n de aniversario con la portada en blanco y negro pues sal√≠ de viaje y no quise llevarme el de pasta dura. Me sorprend√≠ que el contenido es el mismo, refiri√©ndome a que trae las ilustraciones de Grandpr√© al inicio de cada cap√≠tulo etc. El papel en s√≠ es m√°s sencillo, como tipo reciclado por lo que hace que el libro sea m√°s ligero. Muy buena compra."
3032,5,Complet√© mi colecci√≥n,"Compr√© varios tomos para completar mi colecci√≥n, porque s√≥lo hab√≠a le√≠do los √∫ltimos tomos en ingl√©s cuando salieron.Esta edici√≥n no es exactamente igual por fuera, pero no se notan demasiado las diferencias (las letras del borde son doradas y ya no est√° el logo de una de las editoriales). Por dentro se ven id√©nticos.Estoy contento de tenerlos todos despu√©s de tantos a√±os sin tener que volver a comprar todo el set completo."
3033,5,Ein wunderbarer Einstieg in die Zauberwelt von Harry Potter,"√úber die Harry Potter-Reihe an sich brauche ich glaube ich nicht viel sagen. Das englische H√∂rbuch von Stephen Fry ist wirklich eine hervorragendes Werk. Selbst die deutsche Version (gelesen von Rufus Beck) kann damit nicht mithalten. Herr Fry schafft es, die Atmosph√§re und die Charaktere immersiv zu lesen und den Zuh√∂rer somit in seinen Bann zu ziehen. Dar√ºber hinaus ist das gesprochene Englisch sehr zug√§nglich, sodass sich das H√∂rbuch theoretisch auch zum √úben der englischen Sprache bzw. f√ºr nicht so sprachsichere Zuh√∂rer eignet. Insgesamt kann ich das englische H√∂rbuch jedem nur empfehlen und selbst, wenn man die deutschen B√ºcher/Filme bereits kennt, kann man die Geschichten in der englischen Version noch mal  neu erleben!"
3034,1,"Descaso com o cliente, triste...","Comprei o ebook na edi√ß√£o em ingl√™s para aprimorar o idioma, para minha surpresa o livro cont√©m v√°rios erros grosseiros de escrita, depois vendo nas avalia√ß√µes que mais pessoas reclamarem e at√© agora n√£o houve uma atualiza√ß√£o. Ent√£o comprei o mesmo ebook mas a vers√£o ilustrada, e adivinhem, cont√©m os mesmos erros de escrita no ingl√™s, lament√°vel, estou indignado.Do que me adianta ter um Kindle se a Amazon oferece esse tipo de atendimento.Dois livros em ingl√™s, o mesmo t√≠tulo com os mesmos erros de escrita."
3035,3,Calidad/Precio aceptable,"La historia me encanta, y el libro est√° bien. Solo que para un ""tapa blanda"" me parece un poco elevado de precio, pero claro, es Harry Potter, y Harry se vende caro...Si te gusta no lo dudes, pero si te encanta quiz√°s quieras una edici√≥n m√°s robusta, sobre todo para los libros 4 y 5 que son mucho m√°s extensos."
3036,5,The book I fell in love with.,"I‚Äôll never forget the day I first began Harry Potter And The Philosopher‚Äôs Stone. I believe I can say, with out hesitation, that it changed my life. My friend had received it for her birthday, and she suggested we give it a try. I admit I was curious, but I was not expecting anything spectacular. After all, I was an adult, and these books were for children, right? I‚Äôve never been so wrong in my life. From the start, I was entranced. I had no idea where the story was going, but JK Rowling had me hooked. I lapped it up. I kept wanting more, and by the end, I knew I‚Äôd stumbled on to something wondrous. A series that was quite literally addictive. I adored this eleven year old boy, who had captured my heart from the time he was left wrapped in a blanket on his aunt and uncle‚Äôs doorstep. My imagination was caught from the moment the tall wizard appeared on a normal suburban street, put out the street lamps, and began sucking on a Sherbet Lemon. This book has seen me through good times and bad. It‚Äôs been my friend in unfamiliar places, and comforted me when I was sick. What could‚Äôve been such a simplistic idea (a boy discovering he‚Äôs a wizard and being spirited off to magic school) turned out to have so much more to it. Humour, originality, mystery, and above all, plenty of magic. It helped me rediscover books from my childhood that I‚Äôd loved, and has lead to what I suspect will be a life long love of fantasy literature. I am now a firm Quidditch fan, and I think Harry‚Äôs sighting of his dead parents in a magic mirror is one of the most moving and poignant scenes I‚Äôve ever read. And let‚Äôs not forget of course, the truly wonderful narration of Stephen Fry. He really should get an Oscar for all his character portrayals. I‚Äôve never known anyone put so much heart in to what they read. A magical beginning to a magical series."
3037,5,Tornare bambini...,"Ho acquistato questo libro nella versione in lingua originale sia perch√© in italiano non era pi√π disponibile, sia perch√© ero curiosa di immergermi nella scrittura della Rowling. Decisamente soddisfatta. Un'edizione particolarmente bella, secondo me.Spedizione di una velocit√† pazzesca: ordinato nel tardo pomeriggio e spedito poche ore dopo... mi √® arrivato al mattino presto! Assolutamente consigliato!"
3038,5,G√©nial pour apprendre l'anglais,"Le livre est vraiment conforme √† la description . Il a un cot√© un peu f√©√©rique avec ces √©toile en relief .J'ai un anglais plus que d√©butant car je ne sais que les bases et encore certaines sont manquante .Avant de commencer le livre sur un petit calepin j'ai not√© ce qui me sembl√© important comme les bases √† avoir pour lire ce livre notamment tout les petits mots interrogatif : when, what, who, why, howPuis en commen√ßant le livre pour les 2  premier chapitre j'ai not√© les mots que je ne connaissais pas puis leur traduction .J'ai du mettre 1 heure pour les 2 premier chapitre .Arriv√© au 3 eme chapitre je n'ai plus not√© chaque mots mais seulement ceux qui me posent probl√®me et qui reviennent plusieurs fois au fils du texte .Les mots les plus difficile sont pour moi les mots d'expression tels que : grogner, timidement, avidement, etc...Aujourd'hui j'en suis au 6 √®me chapitre et je sens que je m'en sors beaucoup mieux. je comprend presque tout et je mets 20 min pour lire 1 chapitre .Je compte lire tout les livres Harry Potter en anglais car c'est vraiment different de ce en fran√ßais on red√©couvre chaque personnages et chaques lieux ."
3039,5,Smart and witty,"An enchanting story for children and adults alike. Smart and witty. Plenty of adventures, but the same time emphasizing the importance of responsibility, friendship and power of love. It's a book you come back to to discover new facets each time."
3040,5,Die sch√∂nste aller Versionen,"Ich habe viele Versionen der Harry Potter B√ºcher, aber die beiden neuen - diese hier und die von MinaLima - das ist h√∂chste Buchqualit√§t. √úber die Geschichte muss man ja nicht mehr viel sagen, aber sowohl die MinaLima Edition als auch diese sind hochwertig verarbeitet, haben tolles, dickes Papier und sind wundervoll designt. Da gef√§llt mir die Arbeit von MinaLima sogar noch besser, aber das ist sicher Geschmacksache. Der Schuber und das Buch sind mit Stoff verkleidet und es sieht einfach nur sch√∂n aus.Wer ein besonderes Buch haben m√∂chte, macht hiermit nichts falsch.Ich kann es kaum erwarten, die anderen zu holen"
3041,4,Excelente Precio para la versi√≥n en ingles,"Tenia tiempo buscando la versi√≥n en ingl√©s que en M√©xico es m√°s cara, la mejor opci√≥n fue comprarla a trav√©s de Amazon. Buen precio, 100% original, perfecto estado. Solo hay que tomar en cuenta el tiempo de env√≠o porque al ser de importaci√≥n demora un poco aun en Prime."
3042,5,Wundersch√∂nes Design,"Ein wundersch√∂nes Coverdesign, sehr magisch und liebevoll gestaltet. Optisch mit gold-gl√§nzender, gepr√§gter Schrift versehen. Es handelt sich hierbei um ein Taschenbuch. Es ist die englische Originalausgabe von Bloomsbury. Insgesamt w√ºrde ich aber die Complete Collection empfehlen, da dort alle B√ºcher dabei sind und der Preis dabei einfach unschlagbar ist!√úber den eigentlichen Inhalt muss man, denke ich, nicht sprechen: eine bahnbrechende Geschichte, die mich schon sehr lange begleitet. Das muss jeder Mensch einmal gelesen haben! F√ºr Lesefaule eignet sich aber auch der Film gut - Teil 1 ist noch sehr nahe am Buch orientiert, was sich bei den sp√§teren Teilen aber √§ndert."
3043,5,¬°FANTASTICO!,¬°Libro muy entretenido! Para el que le guste la saga de Harry Potter es el primer libro y una vez que empieces te enganchar√°. Lo he comprado en ingles para practicarlo por lo que me ha sido muy util. Es un libro de bolsillo pero las tapas estan muy bien protegidas y la letra es muy leible. Ha venido en perfectas condiciones.
3044,5,The Start of an Excellent Book Series,"The first book is really fantastic, like all six of her books. I remember the first book I ever read was book 4 (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire). I started reading it, but I found the first chapter boring. I gave up. I'm never really in a reading mood and I know I should be, because everybody needs to read and exercise their brain.Anyway not long after, during an english lesson, where we spent the whole lesson reading in silence, I noticed one of my mates was reading one of the Harry Potter books. I remember it was book 3 (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban). I remember asking him if the book was good. He said that it was briliant. Don't laugh but this somehow motivated me to read the 4th book I had at home. I started reading it, ignoring how boring I found the first chapter. Near towards the end of the first chapter, I got hooked onto it. I found myself reading it constantly, getting more and more interested. I found the book fantastic. I couldn't believe I had never read it sooner. I had to read the other three (book 5 wasn't out yet).Anyway the first book is a really good book. No it's more than really good. It's excellent. If you watched the film, then you must read the book. Because believe me when I say that the book is better than the film.It's about a boy (we know his name), who's spent 10 miserable years with his reltives the Dursley family. His uncle Vernon is always jumping down his throught, his aunt Petunia is always nasty, they both see him as filth and his cousin Dudley (about the same age) is always bullying poor Harry. Harry learns on his 11th birthday that he is a wizard. He's not just a wizard, but in the wizard world he's famous.His mum and dad were murdered by the most evil wizard of all time, Voldemort. After killing James and Lily Potter (Harry's parents) he attempted to kill Harry himself. Somehow Harry survived it, left with a permanent lightning shaped scar on his forehead. This somehow defeated Voldemort and Harry was only a baby.He goes to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry, where he trains to be a wizard. He befriends a boy and a girl (Ron Weasley and Hermoine Granger). Ron is a really nice, loyal person and Hermoine is an annoying boffin, who's always siding with the teachers (the last person to trust if you were attempting to break school rules). Harry also makes his first enemy (Draco Malfoy; a nasty Slytherin kid. All the nasty ones end up in Slytherin House). Harry, Ron and Hermoine end up in Gryffindor house. The other two are Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw.Soon Harry and his friends discover that Dumbledore's got something really valuable within Hogwarts (well protected) and someone (their No 1 suspect professor Snape; potions teacher who is nasty to the Gryffindors and is also head of Slytherin).This book is definetely worth reading and buying. Rowling did a fantastic job with this book. Not just the way it was written OR the story, but how she made the wizard life. Their lives are like ours, but with the use of magic. They have a ministry of magic for instance(the wizard govenment), wizard shops and their own sport Quiditch.That I found brilliant. There are Seven players on each team, that fly on broomsticks and there is four balls (a quaffle, two bludgers and a golden snitch) Two beaters hit the bludgers, protecting their team as the bludgers zoom around the pitch, trying to injure the players. Three chasers handle the quaffle and try to put it through one of the three hoops at the end of the pitch. The keeper defends them and the seeker catches the snitch, ending the game and awarding his/her team 150 points. The game was really well designed.The schools are similar to secondry schools. At secondry schools pupils have different subjects in different classrooms, with differnt teachers. The classrooms are designed for that subject. Hogwarts is the same, but with wizard subjects (charms, potions, etc). It's a well written book, inteligently done. One of the best books I've ever read. There's no chance in hell you'll regret getting this."
3045,5,Vale la pena leerlo,"Al ser una de esas personas que ha visto las pel√≠culas primero tengo que decir que s√≠ que es muy fiel al libro, sin embargo, no me fue un impedimento para disfrutar de la versi√≥n escrita sobre todo porque nos hace apreciar m√°s a algunos personajes como los gemelos weasley y adem√°s presenta un nuevo personaje y muy divertido por cierto, peeves."
3046,5,harry potter,"dopo una lunga attesa, non imputabile ad Amazon, ma al pessimo servizio offerto da Sailpost, finalmente oggi 14 dicembre √® arrivato il libro che avevo ordinato il 28 novembre. Amazon ( precisamente la gentilissima Elena A) ha provveduto a rispedirmelo ieri e oggi √® arrivato. Diffidate di Sailpost che rovina l'ottima fama di Amazon; ancora grazie ad Elena"

Por fim, poder-se-ia dizer que o produto veio em condi√ß√µes condizentes e respeitando o cliente, ou seja, muito bem embalado e em excelente estado de conserva√ß√£o."
3048,4,Bellissima edizione,"Stupenda questa copertina e spedizione sempre velocissima, l'unica cosa √® che Amazon maltratta un po' i manga e i libri perch√© li impacchettano con pacchetti molto striminziti e nei bordi possono arrivare un po' rovinati. Per questo do 4 stelle. Comunque per chi vuole migliorare con l'inglese √® ottimo perch√© la Rowling ha scritto il primo libro di HP pensandolo come un libro per bambini, quindi non √® difficile da capire."
3049,4,Wo ist Band Nummer 3 als Taschenbuch ?,"Kann mir einer sagen wo ich den 3. Band der Reihe finde? Ich habe bereits den 1. und 2. Teil als Taschenbuch und kann leider nur den 3. nicht finden (Alle anderen sich bestellbar).  Die  B√ºcher machen sich gut im B√ºcherregal und ich habe vor, nach und nach alle Teil zu kaufen.Bis jetzt hatte ich die Harry Potter B√ºcher nur in den deutschen Fassungen gelesen, um an meinem Englisch zu arbeiten habe ich mich mal ans Original getraut und komm gut zurecht damit."
3050,5,Esattamente quello che mi aspettavo,"ho acquistato la versione con copertina flessibile per uso personale (allenare e migliorare il mio livello di conoscenza della lingua inglese). All'interno non ci sono immagini, la carta √® ruvida (quindi non riflette la luce = ottimo!) ed i caratteri sono grandi. Lo trovo ottimo per il mio intento in quanto la Rowling ha un lessico ricco e variegato, oltre alle sue ormai celebri doti di scrittrice.Lo consiglio sicuramente a chiunque voglia migliorare il proprio inglese con una lettura piacevole adatta non solo ai bambini."
3051,5,Absolutely fantastic read.,"I tried to avoid all the hype and clamour for these books.  But I now realise what I have been missing.  What an author!  Such imagination!  I have just finished the first in the series  .....The philosophers stone, and could not put it down, and I cannot wait to start the next, Chamber of secrets. I was thrilled to find there is 6 or 7 in the series.  These are not just for kids, I am past middle age, and was totally enthralled.  Five stars is not enough praise!"
3052,5,Tolles Buch,"Hab mir den ersten Teil auf englisch geholt, um meine Englischkenntnisse zu vrbessern. Da ich alle schon auf deutsch gelesen habe, und die Filme auch schon kenne ist das eine super Gelegenheit. Die Geschichte an sich ist einfach super. Sowohl geschrieben, als auch zum lesen. Freue mich auf den 2. Teil"
3053,5,EDIZIONE JIM KAY DELUXE....IL TOP DEL TOP!!!!!,"Arrivato puntuale in condizioni eccellenti, imballato con estrema cura. Volume superstramegabello, non bastano i migliori aggettivi per descriverlo. Volume molto pesante, in lingua inglese non lo user√≤ per la lettura ma come gioiello, assieme  agli altri della stessa serie, nella mia libreria!!!!"
3054,5,Perfecto,"El producto lleg√≥ en perfecto estado y en la fecha prevista, adem√°s a un precio much√≠simo mejor que en cualquier librer√≠a f√≠sica.Del producto en si no hay mucho que decir, es la edici√≥n b√°sica de una saga m√°s que conocida. En mi caso lo compr√© para mejorar mi ingl√©s leyendo un libro que ya fuera familiar para mi."
3055,5,Sch√∂nste Ausgabe von Schoolastic,"Halloes ist nun schon das 4te Mal das ich den ersten HP Band kaufe ..diesmal zum verschenken.Die Schoolastic Ausgaben sind - meiner Meinung nach - die sch√∂nsten Ausgaben im Taschenbuch-Format.√úber den Inhalt brauche ich wohl eher nix mehr sagen :)Die Lieferung erfolgte √ºber Nacht,danke Amazon.Klare Kaufempfehlung :D"
3056,5,Fantastico,"Bellissimo e molto semplice da capire. Lo consiglio non solo a chi l'inglese lo mastica ed √® un fan di Harry Potter, ma soprattutto a chi vuole iniziare ad imparare e non sa da dove cominciare. Personalmente ho iniziato a leggerlo in inglese proprio per migliorare il mio inglese e mi sto trovando molto bene, al di l√† di questo √® arrivato in ottime condizioni. Fantastico."
3057,1,Not as advertised.,"Product was not at all as described. Was advertised as a very good paperback copy and instead I received something more along the lines of acceptable. The pages are very yellowed, there is a coffee or tea stain on the bottom corner of all of the pages and on the top of the cover by the spine is a sticky residue that has collected dirt and other debris."
3058,4,HP √® garanzia,"Da tempo desideravo acquistare una copia in lingua originale della saga e quest'edizione da prezzo decisamente conveniente (e dalla copertina davvero bella!) era inevitabile che mi tentasse.La scrittura elegante della Rowling fila come seta ed √® comprensibilissima anche a chi non eccelle nella lingua inglese, √® perfetto anzi  se si vuole iniziare a leggere libri in lingua.Io l'ho preso usato e, a parte la copertina un po' malandata, il resto √® in perfette condizioni, non sottolineato e tutto come da descrizione.E' arrivato nei tempi previsti, persino con leggero anticipo."
3059,5,Libro,Perfetto.. Ho comprato questo libro per esercitarmi nella lingua inglese e devo dire che √® fantastico .. √® di facile comprensione e per me che sono un fan della saga √® spettacolare.. inoltre √® arrivato con 2 giorni in anticipo.Complimenti al venditore sicuramente comprer√≤ anche i libri seguito da lui.
3060,1,Sale et effac√©.,"Il s‚Äôagit du tome 1 de Harry Potter √† l‚Äôecole des sorciers version  anglaise.Command√©e  d‚Äôoccasion, il √©tait notifi√© que le livre √©tait en tr√®s bon √©tat.Cependant √† l‚Äôarriv√©e le livre √©tait extr√™mement sale (il collait ), il m‚Äôa fallu le nettoyer plusieurs fois avec un chiffon humide.De plus l‚Äôinscription sur le devant du livre √©tait effac√©e .Je ne suis pas satisfaite de cet achat.M√™me d‚Äôoccasion il √©tait mentionn√© en tr√®s bon √©tat je le rappelle.Je pr√©cise que je suis une habitu√©e des achats d‚Äôoccasion .La qualit√© n‚Äôest pas √† la hauteur du prix.J‚Äôesp√®re que ce commentaire vous sera utile, si vous avez des questions n‚Äôh√©sitez pas ."
3061,5,La pietra filosofale delle mie letture d'inglese,"Ho acquistato questo libro nella versione ebook per esercitarmi con l'inglese. Niente di meglio che leggere da un dispositivo kindle, che ti permette di accedere con velocit√† ai dizionari inseriti per confrontare lemmi e apprendere nuovi vocaboli. In pi√π l'inglese della Rowling √® apprezzabile anche per chi non √® di madre lingua, proprio per il suo potere immaginifico, per il talento di creare nella mente del lettore immagini affascinanti. Non per niente l'intera saga ha avuto un ampio successo trasposta su celluloide. Consigliatissimo!"
3062,5,Consiglio!!!,"Se ami la saga Harry Potter e vuoi anche migliorare il tuo inglese, il modo migliore √® leggere i libri di Harry in lingua originale. Molto divertente e appassionante. Il livello di inglese usato √® molto agibile.La stampa √® ottima e il prezzo √® pi√π che giusto...consiglio!!!"
3063,5,Utile per migliorare l'inglese,"Come la maggior parte degli utenti ho acquistato la versione inglese per migliorare la lingua, visto che comunque Harry Potter si presta abbastanza bene per un livello intermedio. Oltre a ci√≤ non ho nulla da aggiungere, stiamo parlando di un libro che ormai quasi chiunque conosce. Davvero molto bella la copertina."
3064,5,Un classique,Ayant lu les Harry Potter en fran√ßais je voulais le relire en anglais et j‚Äôai √©t√© √©tonn√© par la qualit√© du livre ce qui me permet de faire des annotations dessus
3065,5,What a great Story! Love it! <3,"Zur Geschichte brauche ich nicht mehr sagen. Einfach sch√∂n. <3Aber ich kann dieses Buch auch Leuten klar empfehlen, die Ihre Englischkenntnisse verbessern m√∂chten. Sehr verst√§ndlich geschrieben und als eBook kann man sich unbekannte W√∂rter √ºbersetzten lassen."
3066,4,A must for children who have not learned to love books,"granddaughter enticed me to the first edition of H.Potter. She tests my enjoyment of the book with  a list of trivia questions about events. potions, characters and places in the book. e.g what were the dragon eggs soaked in to make them hatch. what are Muggles people. if one is looking for child trivia games this is the book to start with. I am 79yrs  and have read my first J.K Rowlings. it should be a memory test for us older folks there is so much to love and remember about Harry"
3067,5,Vom Englischlehrer empfohlen,"Ich liebe die Harry-Potter-Geschichten. Die englische Ausgabe wurde mir von einem meiner Englischlehrer empfohlen aufgrund der sehr guten Grammatik und richtig angewendeten Zeiten, wie aus dem Lehrbuch! Also nicht nur f√ºr Kinder optimal geeignet, sondern auch f√ºr Erwachsene, die ihr Englisch auffrischen wollen."
3068,5,Arrivato prima del previsto,"Sono una fan di Harry Potter e volevo leggere i libri in inglese, e ho scelto questa collezione per le copertine. Ovviamente il primo libro √® bellissimo, rileggerlo poi in inglese √® fantastico. √® arrivato addirittura prima del previsto."
3069,4,"Libro bellissimo, formato...economico","Il libro non ha bisogno di recensione: tutti conoscono la saga di Herry Potter. La cosa che un po' mi ha delusa, √® la qualit√† del tomo. E' ovviamente un formato economico, ma sono comunque pi√π di 7 euro, mi immaginavo qualcosa di un po' pi√π curato. Diciamo che non mi far√≤ problemi a portarlo in spiaggia, per paura di rovinarlo"
3070,5,"Molto bello, agevole lettura, nessuna illustrazione","La trama √® nota: avvincente anche per chi non √® pi√π ragazzo!E come di consueto leggere in lingua originale ha un gran valore aggiunto! Ben comprensibile se si ha un discreto Inglese, copertina morbida molto gradevole al tatto, peccato solo che sia totalmente privo di illustrazioni."
3071,5,On en redemande...,"Livr√© en parfait √©tat.Tr√®s bon livre pour apprendre l'anglais. C'est un livre de jeunesse donc le vocabulaire et la structure des phrases sont compr√©hensibles pour qui a fait un minimum d'anglais. On peu approfondir le vocabulaire perso par le biais de certaines descriptions faites par Rowling.Quelques diff√©rences avec le film qui ne changent rien de particulier √† l'histoire. Le film a bien respect√© l'≈ìuvre, surtout au niveau des effets sp√©ciaux. Certains chapitres sont captivants, on p√©n√®tre vraiment dans l'univers de Potter et de ses amis √† Hogwarts.J'ai command√© le deuxi√®me tome, en anglais toujours. Que du plaisir !"
3072,4,"Great book, but for die-hard Potter fans only!","This is a great book for die-hard Harry Potter fans!But, before I go to far, there are a couple of important differences between this deluxe slipcase edition, and the cheaper, non-slipcase edition. First of all the deluxe version is physically larger than the regular illustrated version. Slipcase aside, the book itself is about 2 inches taller and about 2 inches wider. Overall, the deluxe version is about 13 inches tall and approximately 11 inches wide, which may make it a tougher fit on some people's book shelves. Also, the deluxe version is printed in Italy, whereas the regular illustrated version is printed in China. Although I didn't do too many side-by-side comparisons of each book, it does seem like the illustrations in the deluxe version are much brighter than the cheaper version printed in China -go figure.I should also point out that I purchased my deluxe version through BWBCanada and the book did not arrive in shrink-wrap. So, if any of you are buying this for collecting purposes keep that in mind. However, the price was WAY better than Amazon's price, the book arrived on time, and there were no additional fees, import fees, or duty. I only paid what was charged during the Amazon check-out procedure, and when I picked this parcel up at the post office, I did not have to pay anything extra.Lastly, I'll say it again, this book is for die-hard Harry Potter fans only. The deluxe slipcase edition is very expensive and really doesn't offer that much above the regular illustrated version.Update:I would also like to add that the customer service at BWBCanada is fantastic. I had quite a few questions that needed to be answered before I felt comfortable ordering this book from this company and every time I sent an e-mail to BWBCanada, the customer service representative answered all my questions in each e-mail. This was my first time ordering a book from overseas (UK) and I had a lot of questions about duty, import fees etc. and they did a fantastic job of reassuring me before I placed my order. I would definitely feel comfortable ordering from them again."
3073,5,Einfach magisch,"Nachdem ich lange nichts vom Hype um den Zauberlehrling hielt, hat es mich nach dem ersten Film nun doch in den Bann gezogen. In der Originalsprache l√§sst sich das Buch fast noch schneller verschlingen. Es ist sehr einfach geschrieben, aber dennoch so detailliert, dass man in die Welt von Hogwarts auftaucht und erst wieder zu lesen aufh√∂rt, wenn man zum zweiten Buch greifen muss.Gro√ües Plus: die wundersch√∂n gestalteten neuen Cover, die mit ihrer Einfachheit √ºberzeugen! Und das Papier, das beim Verlagshaus bloomsbury um einiges heller und weicher ist, als das der alten B√ºcher von scholastic"
3074,5,Stupendo!,"Libro arrivato in perfette condizioni!La copertina (flessibile) √® stupenda ed ha un effetto lievemente gommato al tatto (come la copertina rigida, da quello che ho letto qua e l√†), l'unica cosa √® che bisogna fare attenzione perch√© tende a sfaldarsi sugli angoli ma se si tiene con cura non ci sono problemi! I colori sono stupendi e penso che sia una delle edizioni pi√π belle! Ho acquistato il libro in lingua inglese perch√© volevo leggerlo anche in originale! Ho appena acquistato anche il secondo volume! üòä"
3075,5,HARRY & STUDIO!,"Consiglio questo libro per chi come me adora Harry Potter, la lingua originale del libro √® un valore aggiunto.Oltre ad essere un pezzo da collezione, ho preso questo libro per poter studiare meglio l'inglese. Lo scopo √® quello di leggere e apprendere pi√π velocemente.Consegna Velocissima (2giorni)  con Amazon Locker, il libro √® arrivato in perfette condizioni e devo dire che internamente si presenta anche perfetto  per lo studio, gli spazi abbondanti tra le righe permettono anche di prendere appunto.5 Stelle...

3076,5,FANTASTICO,"Libro che ho acquistato per approfondire la mia conoscenza dell'inglese, √® stato bellissimo rivivere le avventure del piccolo harry potter, consgigliato per chi cerca un libro semplice in lingua straniera."
3077,5,Libro 1,"Ho acquistato il primo volume di sette, con copertina flessibile e nuovo. Sono pienamente soddisfatta dell'acquisto in quanto il pacco √® arrivato in anticipo e in perfette condizioni (nessuna ammaccatura). Consiglio molto l'acquisto. Unico consiglio specificate se volete un libro nuovo o usato, io non avevo capito subito si potesse scegliere."
3078,5,Ok for teenagers,"Preso per mia figlia tredicenne che ama harry potter. Ha dovuto leggerlo prima in italiano per capire meglio la versione in lingua originale. Lei ha conseguito il certificato PET e mi dice che in effetti senza questi corsi extra scolastici non sarebbe stata in grado di comprenderlo cos√¨, quindi considerate il grado di preparazione dei vostri figli, altrimenti l'acquisto √® sprecato secondo me"

3080,5,Its Harry Potter of course it's good,My son loves the series I ended up buying the whole set after I got this book.
3081,5,Muy bien,Ha llegado antes de tiempo y en perfectas condiciones.Lo poco que he le√≠do es f√°cil de entender y puede ser que me sirva para mejorar elVocabulario y arrancarme con la lectura en ingl√©s.
3082,5,FANTASTICO!!!,"Arrivato in 2 giorni in ottime condizioni. Ho acquistato la versione tascabile, con copertina flessibile che √® vellutata e con scritte in rilievo. √à fatto con molta cura nei minimi dettagli, con recensioni di ragazzi, giornali e anche mappe di Hogwarts. Ha un linguaggio elementare e comprensibile, ottimo per riprendere un po' l'inglese. La copertina √® ben illustrata e CONSIGLIO ASSOLUTAMENTE questo libro."
3083,5,Chiaro e semplice per migliorare l'inglese,"Ho comprato questo libro per  leggere qualche libro in inglese. Il linguaggio della scrittrice √® chiaro e abbastanza semplice, ovviamente con alcuni termini particolari mi sono servito del dizionario. Consigliato, prima di acquistarlo √® sempre meglio conoscere la trama"

Das Buch war super erhalten und sieht echt schick aus.Eignet sich auch gut als Geschenk.Was etwas schade war, dass das Buch vom Lieferanten in den Briefkasten gequetscht wurde. Zum Gl√ºck hat es davon keine Sch√§den genommen.Dennoch definitive Kaufempfehlung."
3085,5,Beautiful collector item,"Beautiful collector item.  Comes in a fitted carton box, and a colour matching slipcase.  Printed in Italy.  The one I bought is a first print.  Will be purchasing the rest of this edition - very happy with the quality!"
3086,5,first book of collection of harry potter,i love this is book! i watched the movie harry potter that 1 years ago but my english now is very limited. i would like talk english  very speed similar my mother language. in the little time i improve new word and new verbs  in only first chapter  and only little pages. thank you so much!
3087,5,Mega gelesen,"Mal davon abgesehen, dass die Harry Potter B√ºcher auf Englisch gelesen mit Abstand besser als in der √úbersetzung sind, ist das Buch von Stephen Fry gelesen wirklich phantastisch!!! So viele Charaktere und er schafft jedem einen eigenen Charakter einzuhauchen. Oft weiss man schon ohne Namensnennung wer gerade spricht. Ich freue mich schon auf weitere CDs!!"
3088,5,Saved me.,"Almost pointless for me to even review this book with the 4,000+ reviews so far but since it is my favourite series I feel I must.I think the thing that is so great about this series is that even though it is a VERY easy read, there is such an amazing description of this other world that you can actually get lost in it. It is so unlike our ordinary lives but the characters are so easily relatable that you can actually believe this world could be real.This book I think saved my life. I read it at a time when I was so depressed and had almost given up completely. I picked up The Sorcerer's Stone on sale to see what the hype was about. I couldn't put it down. There were five books out at the time and so bought the other four right away. And now every time I start to feel a little down I read Harry Potter and it picks me right up and takes me away from my own problems. I have since recruited 3 Potter fans. It's a shame the series ended and I hope J.K. is working on something else that is equally amazing."
3089,5,Magischst,"Nachdem all meine Geschwister und Freunde bereits als Kind Fan der HP-Welt geworden sind, habe ich es erst als Erwachsene geschafft, mich daf√ºr zu begeistern.

It is a book for kids but for adults too. Hogwarts is a magical place and J.K. Rowling is a great writer, she has a fantastic imagination, humour and , most of all, she has a simple style! I look forward to reading all her fantasy books."

3103,4,Un buon acquisto,"Mi avevano spaventato le altre recensioni che parlavano del formato  del  volume  troppo  piccoli, adatto al tascabile. Invece ha le dimensioni di un normale libro, copertina rigida e font nella media calcolando che √®  un libro per ragazzi. Soddisfatta  dell'acquisto, ordinerei anche i restanti albi."
3104,5,Harry Potter,"Sono una fan di Harry Potter, cercavo un libro in inglese da leggere e non potevo non acquistarlo! Per essere un libro con la copertina morbida devi dire che sono davvero soddisfatta, √® resistente, ben decorata e lucida! Insomma, comprateloooo!!!"

La Rowling ha la capacit√† di creare uno stile fluido e scorrevole, ricco per√≤ di modi di dire e giochi di parole che fanno imparare tante cose sulla lingua.

Potrebbero essere inserite anche le dimensioni dell articolo nella scheda delle sue caratteristiche? Perch√® sarebbe importante per le varie edizioni e i vari formati dei libri in vendita. A parte questo comunque tutto perfetto. Sono molto soddisfatto"
3108,5,I watched the movies first and this was still an amazing read!,"If you love the Harry Potter series this is a must read. You will discover many parts in the books that are not included in the movies. The story line, including Harry's thoughts, feelings, and experiences, are explained in much more detail giving the story much more depth.Also, the book cover is very nice and has great artwork."
3109,5,Buena calidad con rapidez en la entrega,Me sorprendio lo r√°pido que me entregaron el libro. La calidad es la misma que si lo hubiera comprado en una tienda con lo que estoy satisfecho con esta compra.

3111,1,Non lo consiglio,"Ho preso un video libro selezionando versione cd , convinto che avrei ricevuto un testo con i relativi cd . Invece ho ricevuto solo i cd . Che cosa me ne faccio io . 28 euro buttati nel cesso. Audio libro senza libro."
3112,5,Parfait !!!,"Un classique ! Harry Potter est sans conteste l'un de mes personnages pr√©f√©r√©s dans les bouquins ! Le fait de pouvoir relire son histoire en anglais m'a vraiment plu ! Je ne suis pas super forte en anglais, mais ce livre m'a beaucoup aid√© √† m'am√©liorer. Je le recommande vraiment pour les personnes qui cherche √† s'am√©liorer en anglais car il est simple √† lire. Je vous avoue que j'ai eu des difficult√©s √† le lire au d√©but, les premiers chapitres √©taient un peu dur et j'ouvrais mon dictionnaire toutes les 5 minutes pour conna√Ætre la signification des mots que je ne comprenais pas. Mais j'ai tenu bon et plus on lit de chapitre et plus √ßa devient facile ! Et apprendre l'anglais tout en lisant l'histoire de ce sorcier √† lunette si connu dans le monde est un bon moyen d'appr√©cier l'apprentissage d'une langue !"
3113,5,Einfach Harry...,Ich habe die B√ºcher alle auf deutsch gelesen und mach es jetzt nochmal auf Englisch. Die Cover sind so s√º√ü gestaltet und die Geschichten sind so liebevoll erz√§hlt.
3114,5,Genial,"Est√° muy bien. El libro comienza bastante lento, pero merece la pena. Lo recomendar√≠a sin dudarlo un instante, sobre todo, para los j√≥venes a partir de 12 a√±os que no est√°n muy acostumbrados a leer. ¬°Seguro que se enganchan a la lectura!"
3115,4,Best book ever,"This fiction book was published in1997. There are 332 pages. To me , it was pretty short as I can read twice the number of pages in 2 or 3 days, not more!It takes place in different places: Number 4 Privet Drive, platform 9 and three quarters at King‚Äôs Cross Station, Diagon Alley and at Hogwarts, school of witchcraft and wizardry. The different settings make the story interesting as J. K .Rowling gives a very good description of all the places, so that you really see them in your head. The book is set during modern times, so today.Harry Potter is the main character in all 7 stories. He turns 11 in this book. His parents are dead because of a wizard, Voldemort, also called the Dark Lord, or You-Know-Who, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, as people are so afraid of him. Harry is famous because he survived Voldemort‚Äôs attack on him and parents. Since he had almost no family left, he went to live with his Aunt and Uncle Dursley and cousin .They hate him and treat him badly. They don‚Äôt tell Harry he is a wizard, so Harry thinks he will be living with the Durleys for the rest of his life until he is big enough to have a house all to himself. He is my favorite character as he is very brave and friendly.Other characters:Ron Weasly is Harry‚Äôs best friend and very scared of spiders.Hermione Granger is also Harry‚Äôs best friend and knows a lot about magic. She always gets good marks in every topic.This is a story about courage, faith, friendship and loyalty.It showed me the importance of having friends and always standing up for the things you think are important.Overall, I thought this was a great book because you can really imagine what it is like to be a witch or a wizard. It is one of my all- time favorites, and I can‚Äôt wait to go on to the 6th, as I am reading the 5th right now but prefer this one!I loved all the adventures, magic, meeting new people‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt care for the part where Harry was arguing with Prof. Quirell , as the dialogue went on for a long time .The ending made me feel good as I had finished a super book.I think that people of all ages can read this book. I don‚Äôt recommend it for smaller children as even I had some nightmares that were horrible.I would give this book 4 and a half stars out of 5, as sometimes there was too much dialogue (like with Prof.Quirell which I found hard to understand).Even so, this book is one of my top 5 favorites.Happy reading!P.T.G."
3116,2,Nicht gut,"Ich hatte die Hoffnung, dass das H√∂rbuch auf englisch ebenso gut ist wie auf Deutsch...leider kann ich mit der Stimme im H√∂rbuch nichts anfangen...geht gar nicht."
3117,4,Perfecto para aprender ingl√©s,"Libro y saga perfecta para aprender ingl√©s. Con vocabulario dirigido a ni√±os y adolescentes, por lo tanto f√°cil de leer para ir adquiriendo vocabulario."
3118,5,Perfeito!,"Sobre a hist√≥ria, n√£o h√° o que falar, pois sabemos muito bem que, Harry Potter dispensa elogios... SIMPLESMENTE FASCINANTE.O livro √© um pouco menor do que pensei, mas √© pr√°tico, a capa √© linda e, √© leve. Para quem est√° acostumado com livros brasileiros, talvez ache um pouquinho de dificuldade para se acostumar com um livro sem orelhas, mas isso, √© detalhe m√≠nimo.A compra vale muito a pena. üíöüêç"
3119,4,Lindo!,"O livro tem uma ilustra√ß√£o linda na capa, assim como a vers√£o da Amazon em portugu√™s. As p√°ginas s√£o confort√°veis pra leitura, boa diagrama√ß√£o e espa√ßamento... o √∫nico ponto negativo √© que o livro se quer tem orelha, o que faz com que ele se torne ainda mais fr√°gil.No geral, considerando a qualidade das p√°ginas, capa e pre√ßo(paguei cerca de R$57,00) o, acredito que a vers√£o em portugu√™s vale bem mais a pena."
3120,5,Libro in lingua originale,"il libro si presenta come da descrizione, con un ottimo imballaggio e ben curato. Non vedo l'ora di iniziare a leggerlo (vocabolario alla mano si intende..)"
3121,5,Bueno,Mi hijo est√° encantado. Una forma amena de introducir a los ni√±os en los idiomas

3126,5,Excelente,"Produto chegou embalado, novo, em perfeitas condi√ß√µes no meu endere√ßo, dentro do prazo estipulado. Comprei a vers√£o na l√≠ngua inglesa norte-americana de capa dura com sobrecapa (jacket) ilustrada. A capa de dentro do livro n√£o tem ilustra√ß√£o, tal qual a antiga vers√£o brit√¢nica infantil. Essa edi√ß√£o, tamb√©m, apresenta, no in√≠cio de cada cap√≠tulo, uma ilustra√ß√£o em preto e branco na margem superior da p√°gina. Folhas levemente amareladas com boa gramatura. Na minha opini√£o √© uma vers√£o de luxo, tendo em vista a qualidade de todo o material. Vale, sem d√∫vida, cada centavo."
3127,5,arrivato velocemente,"considerando che arrivava dall'inghilterra √® arrivato abbastanza presto. comunicazione un po complicata vista la lingua , purtroppo se nn faccio arrivare le cose alle poste i corrieri nn suonano la porta e nn mi fanno firmare. √® gia successo 2 volte"
3128,4,Collana tascabile comoda,"Ho adorato questo libro nella versione in lingua originale (che secondo me √® meglio della versione tradotta come in tutti i libri). Il formato √® compatto e leggero, facile da portarsi dietro."
3129,3,Prodotto sporco,"Spedizione puntuale, libro bellissimo ma non in ottime condizioni, in quanto presenti macchie nere importanti su due lati del libro.Consiglio a tutti i lettori appassionati del genere: Harry Potter √® intramontabile!"
3130,4,Sorprendente,"Edizione economica in lingua Eng a dir poco sorprendente. Copertina molto carina, sia per l'illustrazione sia per la sensazione di morbidezza al tatto."
3131,5,Ottimo,"Spedizione puntuale, nessun segno nella copertina, nessuna pagina strappata. Mi tocca solo iniziare a leggere! Grazie amazon!"
3132,1,"""encaderna√ß√£o para escola e biblioteca"" √© capa dura vers√£o econ√¥mica","a ""encaderna√ß√£o para escola e biblioteca"" n√£o corresponde √† ""capa dura"" dos outros livros da saga em ingl√™s.apesar de tamb√©m ser capa dura, o livro √© menor, menos detalhista e a qualidade da p√°gina √© muito inferior, como na edi√ß√£o em paperback.paguei mais barato na edi√ß√£o ""capa dura"" do segundo livro da saga, que √© a edi√ß√£o de luxo, com jacket e t√≠tulo em relevo (que eu esperava receber pagando tanto neste aqui). decepcionante, essa diferen√ßa nas edi√ß√µes deveria estar sinalizada."
3133,5,Stupendo!!!,Per il prezzo a cui si compra √® veramente di qualit√†... Il pacco mi √® stato consegnato in un giorno ed √® arrivato in perfette condizioni. La copertina √® veramente bella e fatta bene.
3134,5,Stephen Fry liest genial,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher Stone steht seiner literarischen Vorlage in nichts nach, es ist ein sehr gelungenes H√∂rbuch!Stephen Fry gelingt es den einzelnen Figuren Leben einzuhauchen, so dass ein sehr kurzweiliges H√∂rvergn√ºgen entsteht, das besonders durch seinen britischen Slang besticht!Doch man muss sagen, dass Stephen Fry in Rufus Beck seinen Meister gefunden hat.Die deutsche Ausgabe ist eine eins zu eins √úbersetzung des englischen H√∂rbuchs, doch die einzelnen Personen sind NOCH plastischer gesprochen (also die deutsche Variante bek√§me 5 Sterne Plus!)"
3135,5,Optischer Hingucker,"Wer die Buecher auf deutsch gelesen hat, und f√ºr den Einstieg ins englische leicht verst√§ndliches sucht, ist hier richtig. Die Abenteuer von Harry und seinen Freunden im original. Lieferung war z√ºgig."
3136,5,La vera storia di Harry Potter,"Come gi√† scritto anche gli altri libri di Harry potter in versione inglesevi consiglio questo acquisto se volete conoscere la vera storia del maghetto.La traduzione fatta in italiano la trovo davvero poco curata, e qua si trova la vera essenza della storia"
3137,5,Merece la pena,Al comprarlo en ingl√©s y tenerlo en Kindle es muy f√°cil traducir alguna palabra suelta que no se entiende. Adem√°s Kindle proporciona una herramienta que explica aquellas palabras que considera dif√≠ciles. Lo cual ayuda a√∫n m√°s a entenderlo.
3138,5,Come da descrizione,Versione inglese del primo libro di harry potter. Buona qualit√† e tempi di spedizione amazon puntuali come sempre
3139,5,Esattamente ci√≤ che cercavo,"Perfettamente corrispondente alla descrizione, esattamente ci√≤ che cercavo, prezzo un po' alto ma prodotto ottimo, in ottime condizioni, imballato perfettamente, avrei preferito poter selezionare i capitoli come accade con le canzoni di un normale cd audio, datosi che lo uso per ripassare l'inglese seguendo il libro in lingua originale...ma va bene lo stesso."
3140,5,Perfetto,"Il libro ovviamente l'avevo gi√† letto, ma mi mancava la versione cartacea in inglese. Che dire, da vecchia Potterhead ho tutte le prime edizioni e bisogna dire che queste nuove sono favolose!! Il libro √® arrivato in anticipo, contentissima!"

Esattamente uguale a quello in foto. bookdepository mi ha anche inviato un segnalibro fantastico"
3147,4,Great starting point to learn English,"Si proprio una bel modo per iniziare a masticare un po di inglese, la tecnologia kindle inoltre permette di sottolineare le parole non conosciute dando immediata traduzione e possibili sinonimi, Ovviamente il conoscere la storia gia in italiano e' un punto in piu'. Simpaticamente si inizia con un libro quasi per bambini ad apprendere i modi di dire inglesi"
3148,5,Grande Harry....,"Lo presa per mia nipote che √® una fans di Harry Potter lo consiglio a tutti, bravo il venditore e Amazon"
3149,5,Altamente soddisfatta!,"Ho acquistato la versione in inglese sia per poter apprezzare la versione originale, sia per migliorare qualche parola in inglese. La copertina presenta rilievi dorati carinissimi, la qualit√† sembra ottima e all'interno √® presente una mappa Hogwarts!"

All'interno √® illustrato (foto), nonostante sia in copertina flessibile. √à scritto benissimo ed √® anche economico. Davvero stupendo,il titolo sulla copertina e le stelline sul retro sono rialzate e riflettono la luce."

It‚Äôs a brilliant piece of art with beautiful illustrations and elusive items, such as a large wonderful illustrated poster of the north side of diagonally and a beautiful slipcase with gold left ingravings onto a royal purple cloth canvas. It also came in a cool shopping box to protect it, which has a nice illustration of a golden snitch. Overall I think it‚Äôs amazing piece of art! 5 out of 5 Wands!"

Ho trovato giusto un p√≤ di difficolta nel seguire i dialoghi di Hagrid, che in lingua originale parla un dialetto molto particolare, ma una volta fatto il ""callo"" sara tutta una discesa."
3160,5,A very compelling book,"I knew the whole story, so I was facilitated in reading this book. Nonetheless, this story is very rich in details, new vocabulary and idiom expressions that helped me a lot in improving my English reading skill. A thumb up for it."
3161,4,Good,"I must admit it was a good read but unfortunately I watched the movies first and prefer them, especially since i'm not fond of 3rd person pov books.

3166,5,Facinating!,J. K. Rowling offers us  in this masterpiece a really lovely and amazing reading. To follow Potter and his friends in the new world of Hogwarts and finally the journey to protect the stone it was facinating. I really loved this first book. Going now to the 2nd one.
3167,5,Vom standhaften Harry Potter-Verweigerer zum totalen Fan,"Ich muss zugeben, dass ich mich zu Beginn standhaft geweigert habe, Harry Potter zu lesen. Erst als mir jemand das Buch geschenkt hat, musste ich es quasi lesen. Um es kurz zu machen: Ich war mit dem Buch noch nicht einmal fertig, da hab ich mir schon die n√§chsten beiden B√§nde gekauft! Ab diesem Zeitpunkt geh√∂rte ich zu den Lesern, die bereits ein halbes Jahr vor Ver√∂ffentlichung des n√§chsten Buches die Vorbestellung aufgegeben und die Tage bis dahin r√ºckw√§rts gez√§hlt haben."
3168,5,Loved the little kid and the lessons on boys and ...,Loved the little kid and the lessons on boys and how they think and behave. Girls should read this as compulsory. They are hard wired to food and games. Rare to find a boy 13 to80  who does not obey this hard wiring. Good fun read though.
3169,5,Libro ingl√©s,Nivel bastante alto para ni√±os. Perfecto en el caso de mi hija que estudia para avance
3170,5,J'adore !,"J'ai command√© ce livre parce que je souhaite faire la collection des 7. Je n'ai qu'une seul chose √† dire : MA-GNI-FI-QUE !La couverture est sublime et la tranche rends incroyablement bien dans ma collection. Je recommande √† 100%.

3171,5,Interessante,Ho comprato questo libro per ripassare un po' l'inglese; √® facile e divertente.Lo trovo un utile esercizio per rinfrescare l'inglese.
3172,5,Libro magico,"Libro assolutamente fantastico. Partendo dalla copertina che soddisfa gli occhi e il tatto grazie alla sua superficie vellutata e la scritta in rilievo, l'interno presenta un'ottima impaginazione con decori ad inizio capitolo. Prodotto consigliato."
3173,5,Libro adatto ad un primo approccio alla lettura in inglese,"Ho preso questo libro per iniziare a leggere in lingua inglese (ho un b1/b2)Mi trovo piuttosto bene, sono poche le parole che devo cercare sul dizionario.Diventa difficilino quando parla hagrid in un inglese sgrammaticato"

3175,5,Giusy,"Bellissimo libro da leggere in lingua originale. Consigliato a ragazze e ragazzi di tutte le et√†, a chi vuole continuare a sognare e a chi vuole iniziare a farlo."
3176,5,I really enjoyed it,"Read as an adult.One of the best books that I have read. I like that it's in plain English, I'm not impressed by the use of overly flowery words that confuse, especially where a simpler word would be enough. Fortunately this book is an easy read in that sense. Lots of characters, plenty going on in the story, and while it's part of a series, you do get answers before and by the time that you have finished the book. Some surprises and a sprinkling of humour. I feel sorry for Harry at times, the things that he goes through. Hagrid is one of my favourite characters, I like that he is protective. I think that most people, child and adult, would like a giant like Hagrid looking out for them.When I recently decided to begin reading Harry Potter. At first I felt like I was late to the party or something like that. But then I realised that a good book isn't like that. It's not a trend or a fad, it doesn't matter if you're reading it for the first time, years after most others have."

3182,5,Hp √® sempre Hp,Ho letto la saga di Harry Potter svariate volte in italiano e dopo tanti anni ho voluto iniziare la saga nella lingua in cui √® stata pensata e scritta. Per un fan vale sicuramente la pena fare lo sforzo di leggere in un'altra lingua.

3187,5,Excelente compra,Por el precio del art√≠culo es una excelente compra es el libro en pasta dura como dice la publicaci√≥n y la impresi√≥n es excelente
3188,5,Auf Englisch noch besser,Ich habe lange √ºberlegt welche Englische Ausgabe bestelle ich mir und habe mich schlie√ülich f√ºr diese Ausgabe entschlossen. Schon beim ersten Satz habe ich diesen Kopf nicht bereut. Harry Potter l√§sst sich auf Englisch genau so gut lesen wie auf Deutsch.

3192,3,Lange Lieferzeit,"Das Buch hatte eine lange Lieferzeit und kam im eher schlechten Zustand an. Ich vergebe drei Sterne, weil mir der Preis sehr angemessen vorkommt und das Buch... na ja, Harry Potter halt. Da braucht man nicht viel zu schreiben. Auf Englisch genauso toll und verst√§ndlich wie auf Deutsch. Man braucht keine besonderen Kenntnisse. Ich als 8. Kl√§sslerin bin beim Lesen auf keine Verst√§ndnisschwierigkeiten gesto√üen."
3193,4,"Un classico, in inglese √® fantastico","Dopo aver letto la versione in italiano mi sono cimentato con la versione in inglese. Sinceramente penso che renda ancora di pi√π rispetto alla traduzione italiana, che √® peraltro ottima, perch√© ci sono dei giochi di parole e soprattutto di suoni che in italiano non √® stato possibile rendere. Consiglio la lettura ed in contemporanea l'ascolto dell'audiolibro, √® una esperienza unica."
3194,5,"My 9 year old granddaughter watched the movies and loved them, we purchased the book set for her ...","My 9 year old granddaughter watched the movies and loved them, we purchased the book set for her which she also enjoyed, we then purchased the first book on CD and she loves the voices that Stephen Fry creates for all of the characters and went to bed every night listening to it. We have now purchased the full set of books on CD which she eagerly awaits"
3195,5,"Buen libro, recomendable.",Muy buen libro a buen precio. Letra grande especial para quienes se inician en lecturas largas.
3196,5,Excellen. The wrting is fabulous.,I have loved this book for years. The whole series works so well together and is so well written.  It is a spectacular series and we'll worth your time and attwntion
3197,4,Great book for a 10 years old.,The paper back of the book is a bit thin so it wouldn‚Äôt be fab for a present but the content is the same is still Harry Potter... My son loves it!
3198,5,perfetto,Veloci nella consegna e ottimo rapporto qualit√† prezzo.
3199,5,The start of something special.,"Picked as a wild card while ordering multiple books, what a gem.It seems like many moons ago since I watched the first harry potter movie, in fact one of the only ones that I ever did as a child and then didn't return to the series again since reading this book. As I read through it's pages I recalled endless amounts of memories from the film and how it went, it all fits in to place and makes for a very good read.The book length isn't to long nor to short, if you're planning to read them one by one as I was order number two in the series alongside just so that you don't finish the first and find yourself waiting for a delivery to continue the series.This book, the first in the series, is a very exciting and well put together introduction of all of the characters at Hogwarts and their jernouy on their first term. I find it brilliant that J.K. Rowling wrote Harry from a regular muggle to a wizard as it allows the reader to understand the wizardry world as Harry's learning it, to write it in any other way would have been hard to understand, a fine example of the brilliance of J.K. Rowling's writing in this series.The only problem with this book, as written in the book, is that you can't put it down. I decided to drag out the read over days as I like to have the feeling of something to go back to or wake up to and enjoy rather than everything else I do, I want to enjoy my time spent reading and this book certainly allows for that. Each chapter sets of where the last one left and there's no needing to remind yourself of the story before reading again, it all comes flooding back without trouble.I remember the original books and their designs, I think someone I know may still have them stored away somewhere but I defiantly like the look of the newer designed front covers, from the lightning strike in the o of the book title to the general coloring of the book and the feel of the cover I couldn't stop looking at it when I first got it delivered, something about the book draws me in.I have the second book on my bookshelf reading and waiting for the time next I decide to continue with the series, wanting to know more about this world and their adventures I'm sure that all be soon enough.On the whole I hadn't had an interest in the Harry Potter series since a kid as explained but reading this book has made me realize what a gem of a read I've been missing. I appreciate this isn't the newest book in existence and to many they've probably read the last book and watched the last film and it's all over but even then I can imagine that this series is worth a re-read for someone who has the time. So, on the whole, if you're thinking about buying it as I did as something to dive into and see if you do or don't like, DO IT, there's no regret to be had, and at the prices that Amazon are able to offer the paperback version for I can't believe the quality for so little money.Enjoy."
3200,5,Consigliabile,Ottimo libro per mantenere in esercizio il proprio inglese. Lo stile dell'autrice √® fluido.
3201,5,Bien PERO...,"El libro es tal cual se muestra en la imagen. Aunque no ha venido da√±ado, podr√≠a haberlo hecho porque iba sin ninguna protecci√≥n dentro del paquete. He echado en falta un envoltorio de pl√°stico aunque fuera."
3202,5,Perfetto,"Perfetto, in ottime condizioni e la copertina anche se flessibile √® un po‚Äô patinata e gli d√† un effetto particolare. Mi sa che li ricomprer√≤ tutti in inglese! √à un buon modo per mantenere allenata la lingua"
3203,5,"Spettacolare, lo consiglio","Spedizione velocissima in 2 giorni, libro stupendo ovviamente come tutta la saga d'altronde, unica critica da fare solamente alla posta dato il loro corriere incapace che invece di suonare mi ha direttamente lasciato l'avviso di giacenza.."
3204,5,Wundervoll!,"Ich bin ein absoluter Harry Potter Fan, weshalb ""Harry Potter and the Philospher's Stone"" im neuen Gewand in meiner Sammlung nicht fehlen darf.Ich liebe die Geschichte und das Harry Potter Universum, das tolle Design rundet das ganze perfekt ab!"
3205,5,Absolutely love,This is one of the best narrative audio book I have found.Reccomend
3206,5,Recomendo,Adquiri o livro com prop√≥sito de acompanhar a leitura junto com a vers√£o dispon√≠vel no Audible da Amazon. Foi  √≥timo para praticar o ingl√™s e reviver essa hist√≥ria que me trouxe nostalgia da inf√¢ncia. Recomendo.
3207,5,Sehr sehr sch√∂nes Buch,"Das Buch ist sehr sch√∂n geschrieben, und das Cover ist einfach nur richtig super. F√ºr Leute die gerade Englisch lernen ist es sehr gut, besonders f√ºr Kinder. Von der Sprache ist es sehr einfach und verst√§ndlich zu lesen.Ich empfehle es auf jeden Fall weiter"
3208,1,O custo benef√≠cio √© horr√≠vel!!!!!,"Eu paguei um valor muito alto nesse livro e a qualidade √© horr√≠vel. As folhas s√£o fin√≠ssimas, MUITO fino mesmo, e a capa n√£o tem orelha e estraga atoa, voc√™ n√£o pode abrir muito o livro quando for  ler se n√£o a parte de tr√°s fica amassada! N√£o precisa ser um darkside da vida mas eu esperava pelo menos uma qualidade melhor!"
3209,4,Fankram,Potterfans kaufen doch sowieso alles und werden es toll finden. Der kleine Rest: Finger weg
3210,5,Lleg√≥ rapido,"Lleg√≥ muy r√°pido , en perfecto estado y mi hijo est√° emocionado ley√©ndolo"
3211,5,gran libro,"si te gusta la saga, no puedes perderte este libro"
3212,5,Fantastic book and edition,"Not my first rodeo, but this edition is very well made and deliver its purpose, loving to reread it once again"
3213,5,Regalo perfecto y adem√°s en ingl√©s,"A mi sobrino le encant√≥ el libro pero, lo que pasa que cuando vino el paquete estaban las solapas un poco arrugadas y levantadas, por lo que, los o las que hacen los paquetes deber√≠an de proteger m√°s el interior y el art√≠culo."
3214,1,"La portada est√° impresa en baja definici√≥n, sin relieve y no trajo protector","La portada y contraportada est√°n impresas en muy baja definici√≥n. Una de las rese√±as habla de un protector en relieve pero el libro que me entregaron no trajo ninguno. La versi√≥n anunciada (impresa por Paw Prints) no corresponde con la que me entregaron (de la editorial FollettBound). Solicit√© un reemplazo, escrib√≠ un informe detallado con los errores, y me entregaron la misma versi√≥n err√≥nea."
3215,5,A classic we all need to own,"This is my favorite book ever, I got is as a replacement of the one I have for more than a decade. A nice hardcover edition that completed every potter fan collection and that will surely last another decade at least."
3216,5,Livro incr√≠vel!,"Me desafiei a ler um livro em ingl√™s. Como eu n√£o havia lido nenhum dos Harry Potters, decidi ent√£o comprar e ler o primeiro livro. Estou adorando! Estou aprendendo novos vocabul√°rios. A leitura flui muito bem! Adoro o aplicativo do Kindle. √â muito pr√°tico. Uso direto no meu smartphone."
3217,4,Tama√±o,Me gusta el tama√±o del libro aunque hace que la letra sea demasiado peque√±a para mi hijo de 10 a√±os
3218,5,Buona qualita,usato per i miei alunni a scuola davvero buono..

3231,5,Great book!,We had this edition but it went missing. So we bought this as replacement. Very pleased with it!
3232,5,Happy,"Das Buch ist einfach nur sch√∂n, der Umschlag ist aus einem sehr angenehmen Material gemacht und l√§sst sich super fein angreifen. Freue mich schon sehr aufs lesen."
3233,5,Simply the best!,I love reading Harry Potter! I have read it several times and it never gets old for me! Love everything that is Potter related. üíô
3234,5,Beautiful edition,"The original Harry Potter Adult Editions were printed on relatively poor quality paper and the cover art was not really to my taste, so when I saw that Bloomsbury had plans to release a new set with updated cover art I jumped head long and decided to ordered it. I have to say that I am very impressed, the illustrator has used an etching technique which looks really stunning in person, the spine is a bright pink and and contrasts well with the blue;these editions are essentially more contemporary and have had more thought put into them when compared with the mass market paperback adults editions. As for the print size and paper quality, well this is much improved when compared with the older adult editions, the paper feels nicer and the print is a nice size and crisp and clean, in fact, the pagination is exactly the same as the childrens edition. Overall, very pleased."
3235,5,Bello,"C'√® poco da dire , dopo aver letto pi√π volte le versioni in italiano ho deciso di provare la versione in lingua originale ."
3236,5,M√°gica compra!,"La versi√≥n en pasta dura es una belleza pura, me lleg√≥ como lo quer√≠a!! Con relieves en dorado con el protector y pasta dura encuadernada. Una compra super recomendada por precio y calidad ;)"

3239,2,Not in good condition,"These books are definitely not in a good condition, ripped and stains over the pages. The second book I got was OK, with some stains but overall better. I guess you can still read them but wouldn't put them on my bookshelf."
3240,5,Wundersch√∂nes Buch!,"Allein schon f√ºr das Cover lohnt es sich, das Buch zu kaufen. Genauso liebevoll verarbeitet und gestaltet ist auch der Text. Besonders niedlich finde ich auch die Pottermore""Infos hinten im Buch. Es ist einfach wundersch√∂n und viel mehr kann ich auch nicht dazu sagen als: Daumen hoch!"
3241,5,perfetto,tutto perfetto spedizione rapidissima
3242,4,The best young adult book,"This book is a classic young adult. The characters are well described and you can imagine their world just reading the first chapter! I am not exited enough to start the second one. However, I am sure I will read all books from Harry Potter."
3243,5,Super,Perfekt und auch Band 2 wurde schon bestellt.

3249,4,Consiglio,"Un classico della letteratura internazione per bambini e giovami adulti,a mio avviso.In lingua originale la difficolt√† per un italiano che legge poco in inglese √® media. Pi√π ci si immerge nella lettura,minori risultano le difficolt√†.Il prodotto √® arrivato ben confezionato e in tempo.Penso proseguiro',acquistando gli altri della serie."
3250,4,Muy bueno,Buena literatura para j√≥venes que adem√°s practican un idioma diferente. Entretenida y llena de maravillosa acci√≥n. Lectura amena y divertida. R√°pida entrega

3255,5,Highly recommend - the Potter series is hard to put down!,Thought I would jump on this band-wagon to see what the hype has been about. I'm glad that I did. I can't put this book down! Can't wait to get underway with this series; having movies to follow along each novel also keeps it entertaining.
3256,3,Libro per tutte le et√†,"Il libro si presenta come in foto , √® scorrevole e coinvolgente . Adatto soprattutto per chi vuole approfondire la lingua inglese , ottimo rapporto qualit√† prezzo, ha raggiunto le mie aspettative !"
3257,5,wonderful,"Die Stimme von Stephen Frey ist sehr angenehm. Ich habe es bereits 3x geh√∂rt und finde das Englische ist leicht verst√§ndlich, da Stephen Frey sehr gut spricht. Er ver√§ndert seine Stimme nicht so sehr wie Rufus Beck, aber trotzdem erkennt man immer wer gerade spricht. Auch ist es sehr gut um sein Englisch aufzubessern. Ich freue mich schon auf die n√§chsten H√∂rb√ºcher....."
3258,4,Ottimo prodotto,Come da descrizione: copertina morbida ma ben fatta! Secondo me una delle migliori copertine inglesi. Consigliato per gli appassionati della saga. Ottimo il rapporto qualit√†/prezzo.

3266,5,Sehr guter und hochwertig verarbeiteter Artikel,"Buch kam sehr schnell und in top Zustand. Die deutsche Version sieht zwar vom optischen ansprechender aus, die englische ist eher befremdlich, aber das kann auch am gr√∂√üeren Bekanntheitsgrad des deutschen Gesichtes  von Harry Potter liegen. Habe gleich noch eins nachbestellt und freue mich sehr auf spannende Lesestunden :)"

3326,5,I gave it a go to see what the fuss was about...,So I managed to avoid the films as I've never really been interested in genre. My sister in law is a Harry potter fanatic and I never really understood the appeal. We are both in our 30s so I thought it was a bit sad to be honest. I have birth to my second child and thought while I'm on maternity I will give the book a go and see what the fuss is about. I find it difficult to stay focused on books and I'm one of those people who needs to re-read a page over and over for it to sink in.I started this book and I'm utterly ashamed to say that I completed the book in no time and I'm now on book six and the proud owner of the entire collection. I've also got a trip planned to the studios and have now watched the films. I'm sat here writing this review in my Harry potter PJ's. My son is also sporting a Hogwarts babygrow. Nice one. I'm as sad as my sister-in-law.
3327,5,Espectacular,"Es una edici√≥n super bonita, el tacto suave de la portada, un dibujo muy bien logrado de los terrenos de la escuela...Una calidad excelente, no pesa nada, ideal para llevarlo en el bolso. Me ha encantado, estoy comprando la colecci√≥n entera de esta editorial"

Le livre est vraiment beau, la couverture a une mati√®re tr√®s agr√©able. L'int√©rieur est tr√®s beau, et il y a la ""carte"" de Poudlard au d√©but du livre. Contrairement √† l'image, il n'y a pas le petit rond en bas √† gauche. Il est vraiment plus beau que sur l'image.Seul petit b√©mol, mais mineur, la mati√®re du livre est un peu ab√Æm√©e sur la couverture de devant, mais √ßa ne ce voit pas, ou qu'avec le reflet de la lumi√®re.Je recommande fortement √† toutes personnes parlant anglais."

3570,5,Amazing gift,Lovely story for the youth and it comes with the beautiful picture cover.
3571,5,My Words are Redundant,"And yet, I feel compelled to type them.As a parent:Best, I feel, for kids starting at around age ten.  Not because a seven year old couldn't handle it, but because once you start a kid on this series, they will voraciously consume them all without stopping.  Ideally I think a young reader should roughly be the same age as Harry in each book, because I think that was the author's intent, as the later books are more mature in theme and more complex in plot.As a Reader:I enjoy the wordplay and clever allusions and the rich, colorful, yet never verbose descriptions of the Wizarding World, but in terms of story and tone, I'm too old for this book.  If you've never read Harry Potter, don't be surprised if you feel this way while reading the first few books (if you make it that far).  For me, the series took off at around book four.As a Consumer:The Bloomsbury hardcover is well made and I enjoy the illustration on the cover.  It's worth noting that the book underneath the jacket looks exactly the same as the jacket itself; the same illustration adorns both.  If you're buying this as an adult and are assuming that underneath the jacket, there is a plain black or brown book that will not stand out on your grown-up bookshelf, think about looking for a different printing.  If you're American as I am (sorry for living) you've come to the right place; the American versions have different wording and even the title of the American version of this book is changed (Sorcerer's Stone).  Unforgivable."

3641,5,Let's Take a Second Look at the Original Harry Potter Novel and See if It Still Upholds Well,"I have reread the first Harry Potter novel for the first time in about 10 years in this latest edition issued by Bloomsbury. Bloomsbury UK has reissued all the HP novels in beautiful new hardcover editions with beautiful dust jacket art by Jonny Duddle. (You can still find some of these in their respective first printings, so try that instead of feeling you need to shell out ¬£15,000 for a hardcover first edition of the original book.) These may be the best-looking of all the HP editions issued by Bloomsbury. Even the original covers for the US editions are not as good as these. But cover art aside, does Harry Potter stand up after a second go-through? Is the charm and excitement still there? After a second reading where I'm actually noticing more than I did the first time, I conclude, yes, Harry Potter and his adventures are still as charming as ever.What is the charm of Harry Potter? How does Rowling make it seem so effortless? Rowling used several storytelling devices to achieve her literary goals. Of course, on the forefront, is Harry Potter himself, a kind of loser kid at first glance, being imprisoned by a family of overweight and pompous nincompoops who might make the likes of the McFly's (from the ""Back to the Future"" films) seem as highly cultured as the Windsors. When I first read the Harry Potter books in the early 2000's, I felt the Dursley's were so disgustingly over-the-top I thought it was the one weakness of the novels. However, upon rereading, I see what Rowling was doing. The magic of Harry Potter is that she offers all these little dilemmas which Harry has to overcome, the first is navigating and then eventually escaping the mad clutches of the Dursley's.While, sure, the Dursley's are just about as crass a family as you'll ever read in children's literature, the Dursley's serve to keep pushing the story further. We know, of course, Harry will escape Vernon and Dudley but the narrative doesn't allow it to happen right away. Like a Beethoven symphony where we're waiting for the main theme to return in tutti fortissimo, we're waiting for Harry to overcome the Dursley's, and other similar situations which permeate much of the book, such as being placed into the right ""house"", learning the game of Quidditch, and the climactic ending where a kind of oversized chess match may mean life or death for Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione. And this is how the novel keeps us interested and desiring to read more. She doesn't offer the solutions and/or resolutions of the many dilemmas to end too quickly, and often the resolution is not exactly as expected but rather lead into the next problem. Only Rowling could dream up having the Dursley's move to a shack on an island just so Harry won't be able to receive copies of the letter inviting him to enroll at Hogwarts, School of Wizards and Wizardry. This is just one example of the many situations Harry faces during the course of the novel. In most books, especially children's books, there are maybe only one or two dilemmas a main character may face. Harry is constantly being pelted with them.Another aspect of the story, nearly as important, is the wonderful details which Rowling gives her readers. When we enter Diagon Alley along with Harry, she describes not only the many shops, but little tiny vignettes about the many people wandering through this first taste of the ""magic world"" as opposed to the ""muggle"" world. (I wish I wasn't a muggle!) Shops, shopkeepers and shoppers are all going about their business and Rowling tells us about them with just enough flair and detail we're interested in what we're seeing but not too much for it to become overdone. We always come back to Harry and Hagrid and why they're walking through Diagon Alley, which rings of London's Charing Cross Road, known for its bookshops, and Portobello Road, famous for its many antique and unusual shops.Harry Potter is almost a series of threaded vignettes which create a beautiful mosaic of storytelling at a phenomenal level. I have read few books of fantasy which have as much detail and depth as Harry Potter, with a bit of humour and a bit of darkness to keep the story well-balanced. J.R.R. Tolkien's the Hobbit comes to mind, as well as some of the Conan stories by Robert E. Howard. Rowling's Harry Potter books have just about everything: wonderful characters occupying an imagined world coupled with situations and plots to keep the reader interested in the seeming never-ending threads of story. On top of it, there is an underlying rhetorically theme.Before he learns who he really is, Harry Potter views himself as a loser kid who has nothing to offer, except his ""moments"" which cause him to be punished at the hands of the Dursley's. As the novel progresses, we learn he's something special, and part of the growth of the character is for him and his readers to discover the essence of his specialness. All children, and adults for that matter, should know, there is something which makes them unique and special, and part of the point of Harry Potter is to find that uniqueness, no matter how much other people may say otherwise. This is the true magic of Harry Potter, brought to us by a wizard, name of J.K. Rowling."

3706,5,Hervorragend,"Mir war der Harry Potter-Hype anfangs zuwider, aber ich dachte, als Bibliothekarin muss ich diese B√ºcher einfach lesen. Und ich bin restlos begeistert. Nach der Lekt√ºre des ersten und zweiten Bandes kann ich sagen: hier stimmt einfach alles - breites, durchaus anspruchsvolles Vokabular; originelle Namensgebung (da√ü ein ""Dudley Dursley"" nur unsympathisch sein kann, wird jedem/r einleuchten); eine f√ºr Klein und Gro√ü spannende Geschichte; eine durchdachte Szenerie. Mit wievielen Personen diese Zauberwelt bev√∂lkert wurde, ist ebenfalls bemerkenswert. Daher: eindeutig f√ºnf Sterne!"
3707,5,Very good quality!,Amazig !
3708,5,Formidable,J‚Äôai achet√© ce livre car j‚Äôapprends l‚Äôanglais. C‚Äôest l‚Äôun de mes livres pr√©f√©r√©s et √ßa rend l‚Äôapprentissage de mon anglais plus amusant.Livraison rapide rien √† redire.

3710,5,it really is to be enjoyed by all ages,"On the doorstep of Petunia and Vernon Dersley's house, a baby is waiting to be found.This baby is their nephew-Harry. He lives with his aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon and his cousin Dudley for eleven of his young years.Eleven years of tolerating his unpleasant, miserable life sleeping in the cupboard under the stairs, and being excluded from any family activity and thinking his parents died in a car accident which caused his lightening shaped scar on his forehead.After being rescued by Hagrid, the grounds keeper at Hogwarts school,Harry is invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,where his parent's had also spent their secondary school years.There he and his new friends find out about the evil one known to all around simply as 'You Know Who'.Hogwarts is a truly magical place. Hogwarts is a place that everybody wishes they could have gone to when they where eleven.Everyone that is anyone knows all about Harry, including the story about that interesting scar which Harry soon finds to be different to the one he has been led to believe. Hogwarts school is full of excitement,fantasy,mystery and friendship but Harry soon learns that there is also dark magic around him and enemies out to get him.This book has it all in spades including a three-headed dog, an attacking troll and a life sized, come to life chess board.Although this book is aimed at children, it really is to be enjoyed by all ages.I am totally enamoured by the first book in this series.I never read/watch anything when it is in the 'hype' and only recently watched the films in full, and in order. I am so glad I chose to read the books as well.I didn't want my imagination influenced by the films and am very glad to say, it wasn't.There is so much more to the book, much more detail that isn't in the film, and so the book was a whole new imaginative fantasy playing out in my mind.There is a huge amount of action packed into this amazing warm book. JK Rowling's writing style flows beautifully with crafty segments of humour scattered amongst it, that made me chuckle out loud.It's such an easy read and will appeal to children and grownups alike.I can't wait to rediscover the rest of this series and enter Hogwarts magical world once more."
3711,5,Magnifique !,"Livraison rapide et re√ßu deux jours avant la date pr√©vue. J'ai h√©sit√© avec le m√™me livre mais en reli√©, sauf que le prix √©tait doubl√©.

3748,4,Double review: Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief (Rick Riordan) v. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Rowling),"Double book review:Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief (Rick Riordan)Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Rowling)These are two very different books, aimed at roughly the same age bracket and both the start of a multiple volume series.To appreciate Harry Potter's book, one must have acquired a taste for quality writing, attention to detail and subtlety. To appreciate Percy Jackson's one only has to be able to read (a penchant for Greek mythology will also come in handily).Harry Potter is very well written, using a language that is simultaneously sophisticated and accessible to younger readers, a no mean feat. It is also the epitome of Britishness. There is a posh quality to it, an underlying assumption that readers must make an effort and have cultivated some sort of ""good"" literary taste. This is a book that goes well with shoegazing, faded wallpapers (the ones on actual walls, not the digital ones) and unbelievably bad sartorial choices. On the weak side (yes, I know it sounds odd, but I was being appreciative...) the book is slightly boring, doesn't have that much of a plot and sounds more like a diary than an adventure story.Percy Jackson is pure American entertainment industry fodder. It is competently written, but just so. It is imaginative and evolves at a regularly fast pace. It is a page turner (which Potter struggles to be) and is easily enjoyable. In a sense, and within the constraints of both books being roughly the same genre and for the same public, they are the opposite of each other. This is a book that goes well with Aerosmith, baseball caps and deluded world views.In the end both books get four stars but for very different reasons. Rick Riordan's book reaches the epitome of everything it sets itself to be, but its goal is one that, even if honed to perfection, is never worth more than four stars. Rowling's book aims higher but doesn't quite get there, so fails to earn the last star, which it could have earned had it managed to be more of a page turner without losing any of its present qualities."
3749,5,Five Stars,very good
3750,5,Good buy,Awesome
3751,5,Harry,Tolles buch
3752,5,La magie en anglais,"Apr√®s avoir vu, revu et re revu les films, j'ai d√©cid√© de prolonger la magie en m'attaquant √† la lecture des aventures d'Harry Potter en fran√ßais... puis en anglais (si vous √™tes d√©butant dans la langue, n'h√©sitez pas, c'est un tr√®s bon ouvrage pour commencer). La couverture est magnifique, et l'histoire qu'elle renferme l'est tout autant. Et je vous l'assure, m√™me apr√®s tant de temps √† √™tre fascin√©e par l'univers d'HP, il n'en perd pas moins sa magie. After all this time? Always."
3753,5,A firm favourite,"This is a great book, filled with wonderful characters who are richly described and a pleasure to read about. One of the best things about this book is the way the characters develop, learning magic and the ways of the magical world as they, without immediately becoming super powerful and capable of doing anything; the characters, certainly the main trio of Harry, Ron and Hermione, complement each other well with each bringing something to the group.Along the way to the final confrontation there are laughs as well as some more serious scenes, all of which, though the book is intended for a younger audience, fit to be enjoyed by adults.I‚Äôve read Harry Potter and the Philosopher‚Äôs Stone more times than I can remember and continue to enjoy it, which I consider as important, if not more so, as how well the book‚Äôs written. In this case the book is both well written and enjoyable, and is likely to remain a favourite of mine for years to come."
3754,5,Classico,"Perfecto estado y como siempre un gran libro. Classic, always glad to read that book. Nice shape and perfect sent"
3755,5,"Trolle, Treiber, Turbantr√§ger","Inhalt:An seinem 11. Geburtstag erf√§hrt Harry Potter, der seit dem Tod seiner Eltern bei seiner Tante Petunia, seinem Onkel Vernon und seinem Cousin Dudley lebt, dass er ein Zauberer ist und dass er ab sofort an der Hogwarts-Schule f√ºr Hexerei und Zauberei alles √ºber Magie lernen darf. Ein Abenteuer beginnt, das ihm neue Freunde, wundersame Ereignisse, eine v√∂llig neue Welt, doch auch ungeahnte Gefahren beschert.Mein Eindruck:Ich habe die Harry Potter-B√ºcher bereits mehrmals in Deutsch und in Englisch gelesen sowie als H√∂rbuch geh√∂rt - und bin immer wieder begeistert. Im R√ºckblick ist der erste Band der Reihe der am wenigsten komplexe und am meisten kindgerechte, und J.K. Rowlings Stil ist noch nicht so ausgefeilt wie in den Folgeb√§nden. So haben sich in 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' kleinere Logikfehler und eine gewisse, zu h√§ufig auftretende Affinit√§t zu bestimmten W√∂rtern eingeschlichen. Doch bereits in ihrem Erstling beweist die Autorin eine nahezu grenzenlose und wunderbare Fantasie, einen Sinn f√ºr Sprachwitz und zauberhafte Details sowie die F√§higkeit, Protagonisten komplex und glaubw√ºrdig zu charakterisieren.Das Buch ist im englischen Original auch f√ºr Nicht-Muttersprachler leicht zu verstehen und eine gute M√∂glichkeit, das Verst√§ndnis der englischen Sprache zu verbessern. Viele der Andeutungen, Witze, Bedeutungen von Namen etc. gehen zudem durch die √úbersetzung ins Deutsche verloren und k√∂nnen nur im englischen Original verstanden werden. Wenn man beide Ausgaben kennt, f√§llt zudem auf, dass es in der deutschen Version einige √úbersetzungsfehler gibt.Mein Res√ºmee:Ein Auftakt mit kleineren M√§ngeln. Wer in die Harry Potter-Welt einsteigen m√∂chte, nach dem ersten Buch jedoch noch nicht ganz in Rowlings Welt eintauchen konnte, sollte unbedingt dem n√§chsten Band eine Chance geben, denn Rowlings Geschichte wird deutlich anspruchsvoller, cleverer und komplexer als der erste Band ahnen l√§sst."

3780,5,Beautiful book if a little pricey.,"Firstly it is huge!  I should have checked the dimensions but it is big.  It comes in a cardboard box (also with an art sketch on it) which is nice for storage/protection.  The actual book and slipcase are beautiful and appear to be good quality.The illustrations are fantastic.  I haven't seen the regular illustrated edition to compare although intend on buying that one for my daughter to read and keep in her bookcase, this one we will read together, it's probably too big for her to manage on her own.Bonus is that it is printed and bound in Italy, I always appreciate a book not printed and bound in China as so many are these days.Is it worth ¬£150, I'm not sure, I love it but ¬£150 is expensive.  Definitely a good buy when on offer though."

3843,5,Bezaubernd,"Um endlich meine Englischkenntnisse wieder auf Vordermann zu bringen habe ich mich entschlossen mir ein Harry Potter-Buch zu besorgen, da der Hype gerade auf dem H√∂hepunkt angelangt war. Mittlerweile habe ich das Buch vor 3 Tagen wieder in die Hand genommen und gerade eben ausgelesen - nicht, weil mein Englisch wieder eingerostet war, sondern weil auch ich mich als Erwachsener gerne in diese Welt voller Fantasie entf√ºhren lasse. Ich versuche logische Fragen (Wo in Rum√§nien leben die Drachen? Wurden sie mit einem Unsichtbarzauber belegt, um nicht gesehen zu werden? F√§llt den Muggeln wirklich gar nichts auf? Sind Muggel-Eltern nicht zutiefst schockiert, wenn ihr Kind nach Hogwarts gehen soll und keinen ""anst√§ndigen"" Beruf erlernt? Verkraften diese Eltern die Existenz einer solchen Welt wirklich so schnell?) hinten anzustellen. Man muss nicht immer alles erkl√§ren k√∂nnen (leider eine Unart der Erwachsenen). Diese B√ºcherreihe bietet die Gelegenheit das Kind im Erwachsenen wieder lebendig werden zu lassen. Da werden Geschichten erz√§hlt √ºber die Entstehung von Freundschaften, es werden Werte vermittelt, es werden √Ñngste beschrieben und √ºberstanden, es wird die Liebe als eine ungeheuer gro√üe Kraft beschrieben.Endlich k√∂nnen die Gro√üen, wenn sie es denn wollen, auch bei Kinderb√ºchern (au√üer M√§rchen, die ja eigentlich nicht wirklich f√ºr Kinder gedacht sind) fantastische Abenteuer mit vielen liebevollen, au√üergew√∂hnlichen Ideen der Autorin und einem gut durchdachten Handlungsbogen, erleben und mitfiebern, wie Harry Potter mit viel Gl√ºck und Unterst√ºtzung ein Abenteuer beginnt, welches noch weitere 6 B√ºcher umfassen soll.Und die Lesefertigkeit f√ºr die Harry Potter-Reihe muss nicht perfekt sein - schlie√ülich wurden die B√ºcher f√ºr Kinder geschrieben. Sie sind leicht verst√§ndlich und ein W√∂rterbuch ist kaum vonn√∂ten. Viele Vokabeln erkl√§ren sich durch das Lesen von selbst."

3887,5,super,"ma fille cadette √† beaucoup aim√© que je lui offre ce livre de Harry Potter en anglais. A continuer la s√©rie, cela lui plaira"
3888,5,Absolutely Magical.....,"What a great beginning to a wonderfully enchanted series of books....A children's novel read secretly by just as many adults as that of prepubescent young minds. Each chapter equally magical and in bite-size chunks that are good for reading at bedtime or during a coffee or two. This is Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts the school for wizards and witches, and 'the boy who lived', has a lot to learn in class. Realising that you are famous at the age of eleven after a dark lord has tried to kill you after taking the lives of your parents, being sent to stay at your aunt and uncle as a baby, and then being told when you start secondary school, you are actually a wizard like your father before you takes a while to sink in. On top of all that, you have to make friends and know your enemies, fight a troll, learn to play Quidditch and also defeat one or two teachers who are trying to murder you...oh and there are the end of year exams to pass unless you want to flunk magic.Definately a rewarding read for adults and children and have already bought the six continuing books in the set. As for the book design itself, these new covers are detailed with a scene from each book and the pages themselves are a great quality with the text a great size that I can read well without my glasses on..although after reading Harry Potter I think glasses are pretty cool!!!"

3918,5,Magical cd.,"Delighted by this cd set. It was purchased to replace a set which our daughter had managed to get acrylic paint on...and consequently wouldn't play...in spite of being a magical cd! This first Harry Potter, in the voice of Stephen Fry, is just perfect."
3919,4,Excellent,Excellent pour reprendre les bases de l'anglais. Grand fan de l'int√©gralit√© des ouvrages. Je les relie en anglais. Conseille vivement.
3920,5,je suis fan,je suis une grande fan donc j'adore m√™me si l'anglais n'est pas √©vident... je le recommande.. il vaut mieux avoir le dictionnaire Harry potter
3921,5,plus que satisfaite,"c'est harry Potter, pas de mot √† rajouter c'est juste le feu, l'esth√©tique du livre est magnifique et merci J.K Rowling"
3922,5,"HP1 in english, please...","Bon produit, excellent √©tat eu √©gard au prix d√©risoire ! Plut√¥t agr√©able √† lire m√™me si on est pas bilingue."
3923,4,Le premier de la s√©rie,"A la d√©couverte de Harry Potter. Les premiers pas √† Poudlard, les premiers ennuis, l'aventure commence pour le lecteur et c'est un plaisir."
3924,3,Thought it included colourful pictures.,"Somethign in the description, when I bought this, led me to believe there were colourful pictures dotted throughout the book. Either I misread or was mislead, as ths is not the case. The cover picture is lovely, but that was it.Overall, there's no doubting the brilliance of the Harry Potter stories, but don't buy this expecting loads of colourful pictures like I did."
3925,5,My Willpower is Finite,"You know, I'm getting really sick of this. I haven't had this much of a problem with a book series since I started collecting Hercule Poirot. Every time I turn around the books are being rereleased and every time they are, the cover art is so much more fabulous than the last design. This isn't fair! I already own them, I shouldn't be repeatedly tempted to rebuy them! I only have so much restraint!Seriously, the series is fantastic and the cover art for this rerelease is the best yet. It'll make both a great present and splurge. And if you already own the series, I suppose you could always 'accidently' send out your current editions with the recycling and need to replace them."
3926,5,Five Stars,"Just amazing, worth every penny"
3927,5,Perfect!,"I'm EXTREMELY happy with this seller. The book is in great conditions but the thing that most surprised and pleased me is that it arrived 5-9 days EARLIER. I don't know how that happened, I really don't. I ordered it two days ago, on the 8th of July, the estimated day of delivery was 15-19 july, but it came today! It's got my name on it so there's no doubt it's the one thatbI ordered.Now, the book itself is, as I said earlier, in great conditions. There's nothing wrong I could say about it, the print is amazing, pretty much everything's amazing. As a HP fan, I'm really excited to have it because it's a beautiful edition, but also my VERY OWN FIRST HP book.I'd recommend this seller to everyone, not just because of the delivery thing, but because of the condition of the book too!"
3928,5,but I'd definately recommend! And as for the story - if you ...,"Realised all of my books were getting tatty and discovered these in waterstones - they're too gorgeous to pass up! I'm buying them all slowly because they're fairly expensive, but I'd definately recommend! And as for the story - if you haven't already read the series, buy it immediately"
3929,3,in good,"Received as described, in good condition"
3930,3,Enjoyable but unoriginal,"This book reads like a greatest hits of english children's authors, its fun despite a pedestrian style. With a little work these characters could become popular and the author may make a decent living."
3931,3,Reading,"Read all books, did not want it to end"
3932,3,Rips off other works too much but daughter likes it.,Rips off The Worst Witch and Terry Pratchett's works too much for me. I'd give it a lower score if my daughter didn't like it as much. Also this book got kids reading books and kindles again.
3933,5,brilliant.,What can I say.......brilliant.
3934,4,"4 STELLE, Buon prezzo ma questa carta non mi soddisfa","Non parlo della trama e di come sono scritti i libri, tutti conoscono la saga e il modo di scrivere dell'autrice.L'ARTWORK della copertina mi √® piaciuto molto pi√π della versione Italiana.Il FORMATO del libro √® tascabile, stava largo nel borsello da spiaggia (si me li sono portati in vacanza al mare).La CARTA utilizzata non √® delle migliori e sembrano tutti un pochettino fragili ma del resto a questo prezzo non pretendevo nulla di pi√π!Ho deciso di comprare la serie in Inglese perch√® dovevo prepararmi per il TOEIC ed erano consigliati come libri da leggere per crearsi delle buone basi. Per chi ha il mio stesso intento consiglio vivamente la saga di Harry Potter perch√® tutti i libri non hanno una sintassi difficile, dato il target di bambini/ragazzi che hanno i libri.Se si sono gi√† letti i libri in Italiano si otterranno dei buoni miglioramenti per il proprio lessico in Inglese, o almeno cos√¨ √® successo a me!4 STELLE bene Meritate!"
3935,4,Four Stars,Book arrived in good time. Currently being read by my teenage son.
3936,5,Absolut lohnenswert!,"Bei dem Preis √ºberlegt man schon zweimal, jedoch ist diese Ausgabe (f√ºr Sammler auf jeden Fall) jeden Cent wert. Sowohl der Schuber als auch das eigentliche Buch sind sehr hochwertig, die Illustrationen sind wundersch√∂n und die Seitenr√§nder goldfarben. Zus√§tzlich liegt noch eine gro√üe Faltkarte der Winkelgasse bei. Die Deluxe Ausgabe hat au√üerdem 11 Seiten mehr als die normale illustrated Edition und ist auch um einiges gr√∂√üer und schwerer.Hier noch anzumerken ist, dass das Buch auch sehr gut verpackt geliefert wurde (im eigentlichen Paket nochmal in einer bedruckten Pappverpackung), sodass es wirklich in einem unversehrten Zustand und ohne Transportspuren ankam.Wer nicht soviel Geld f√ºr ein Buch ausgeben m√∂chte, macht auch mit der ""normalen"" illustrated Edition nichts verkehrt (habe ich auch gekauft und verschenkt). Hier ist die Aufmachung nicht ganz so pomp√∂s, die Illustrationen d√ºrften aber die gleichen sein."
3937,5,Englische Sprache/Aussprache unterhaltsam erlernen,"Habe dieses H√∂rbuch (neben den anderen von Harry Potter) f√ºr meinen Sohn gekauft. Ziel war, dass er die englische Aussprache und nat√ºrlich auch sein Vokalbelwissen verbessert. Nicht eine Sekunde w√ºrde ich z√∂gern diesen Kauf zu wiederholen: Mein Sohn hat sich im englischen so deutlich verbessert, dass er jetzt immer h√§ufiger englische Filme schaut, Nachrichten auf BBC sieht und seine letzte m√ºndliche englische Pr√ºfung (Business Englisch) mit Auszeichnung bestand - lieben Dank ""Harry"" :-)"
3938,5,Favoloso,"In italiano √® meraviglioso, ma leggerlo in inglese √® tutta un'altra cosa! Soprattutto per chi, come me, vuole davvero capire le traduzioni fatte, dato che in italiano hanno un po' stravolto oggetti, cose, nomi delle persone. Favoloso! :-)"
3939,5,... grandchild who is now hooked - makes birthday presents easy from now on,A first Harry Potter book for a grandchild who is now hooked - makes birthday presents easy from now on !
3940,5,Amazing!,"The deluxe slipcase edition is beautiful! It was packaged perfectly, with a cardboard box that had the same snitch design as shown on the purple case, and the title written on the spine. Inside that, the book was wrapped in plastic. The book itself is extremely high quality - as in, the pages are so thick at first I thought they were stuck together, but soon got used to the fact that the paper itself was just very solid. The edges of the pages are coated in a very shiny gold (which does make the pages stick together a bit when new, just because the pages haven't been moved since they were coated). The book cover is covered in a nice material with a design of Diagon Alley - the same design which you receive in a long poster inside the book, which was a nice surprise.The illustrations are amazing and this edition is a must-have for any loving fan - or even as a great introduction to a younger person, though this book is very heavy. The darker parts of the story are not illustrated, which as an adult I am a bit sad about, as multiple pages in the later chapters have no pictures, but I understand it was done for children. I'm just an adult who bought this for herself on a whim, and I am so glad I did."
3941,4,Un poco sucio pero se quita con algod√≥n y alcohol.,"Ped√≠ que me reemplazaran el libro porque hab√≠a llegado un poco sucio y era demasiado bonito para tenerlo con una mancha, pero el que recib√≠ ten√≠a m√°s sucias la portada y la parte de atras, total que lo solucion√© frotando un poco con un algod√≥n con alcohol (del de las heridas) y sec√°ndolo con algod√≥n igualmente. Ha quedado bastante bien y el libro me encanta. Adem√°s ped√≠ un jueves por la tarde el reemplazo y el viernes por la ma√±ana ya me estaban entregando el nuevo y recogiendo el defectuoso. Un servicio excelente."

3943,5,Ottimo per imparare,"Davvero ottimo libro consigliato per chi, come me , vuole migliorare nell inglese, difatti J.K. Rowling ha scritto i suoi libri mano a mano che i suoi lettori crescevano, quindi si parte da un linguaggio molto basilare nel primo libro evolvendosi libro dopo libro. Se poi pensate che state leggendo il libro come l autrice lo ha pensato e scritto, con le originali battute in inglese ,con i nomi originali che vengono purtroppo modificati nella traduzione in italiano perch√® non renderebbero o sarebbero privi di senso √® come leggere un altro libro"

3945,4,Qualcuno on conosce Harry Potter?!,"Il libro non ha bisogno di nessuna presentazione, passerei a parlare di questa edizione nello specifico. La grafica √® appena accettabile, all'interno le pagine sono pi√π ruvide e meno piacevoli al tatto rispetto ad altre edizione, l'interlinea √® inferiore alla media e quindi forse il tutto lo rende meno adatto alla lettura da parte dei pi√π piccoli. Resta comunque un ottimo acquisto per chiunque ami il giovane maghetto e voglia leggere le sue avventure in lingua originare (e sono onestamente molto meglio) o per chi voglia una lettura semplice per imparare qualche nuova parola in inglese (considerando che comunque a causa del genere e del target alcune parole sono inventate e la maggior parte delle altre non √® sufficientemente ricercata da permettere un miglioramento del vocabolario a chi ha un inglese avanzato. Ottimo comunque per chi ha voglia di iniziare)"

3948,5,Wundersch√∂ne Neuauflage,"Mal abgesehen von der Geschichte, die mit der Weile fast jeder kennen m√ºsste und die nach wie vor nach all den Jahren noch immer ein Meisterwerk ist, ist das Buch sehr sch√∂n verarbeitet, mit Einband wie ohne. Auch ist es f√ºr Deutsche auf Englisch sehr leicht zu lesen. Wer also Harry Potter noch mal oder erst in der originalen Sprache lesen m√∂chte und wer und wer der englischen Sprache ein wenig m√§chtig ist, dem kann ich diese wundervolle und h√ºbsch anzusehende Neuauflage nur empfehlen."
3949,3,Good to be a first book,"The first time I tried to read the book was ten years ago. I couldn't finish it. Maybe it was my fault. I read it in Spanish and, taking into account that the first half of the book is a bit slow (sometimes boring), that could be the reason.However, I have tried again now, in English, and once you pass the first haundred pages, everything flow quick and the story become more a more interesting. by the last thirty pages I couldn't stop reading.To sum up, It is quite a good first book of the saga that has driven me to start the second one.7 out of 10."
3950,4,pas si √©vident,J'ai voulu me remettre √† l'anglais apr√®s plusieurs ann√©e d'interruption (arr√™t de mes √©tudes). J'√©tais niveau A1 en anglais donc niveau tr√®s faible.J'ai pris ce bouquin car je suis fan de l'univers HP et de plus beaucoup de commentaires ayant mentionn√©e la lecture facile de ce 1er tome en anglais.1-  La lecture n'est pas si facile que cela pour quelqu'un de mon niveau A1. Rien que le r√©sum√©; je bloquais √† chaque mots. . .2-  Lire avec un dictionnaire pendant tout le livre n'est pas √©vident. Je vous conseille d'utiliser le site word r√©f√©rence pour accompagner le livre.3-  J'ai fini le bouquin en 2 semaines en lisant tous les jours donc c'est tr√®s faisable si on est motiv√©. J'ai m√™me command√© le tome 2.
3951,5,Gute englische Anf√§ngerlekt√ºre,"Das Buch ist perfekt, um Jugendliche ab der 6. oder 7. Klasse an die Lekt√ºre englischer B√ºcher heranzuf√ºhren. Der benutzte Wortschatz ist relativ gering und die fehlenden W√∂rter, wie z.b. ""wand""  lassen sich leicht aus dem Text erschlie√üen, da der Filme bekannt ist, oder auch auf dem Kindle mit einem klick nachschauen. Trotzdem ist der englische Text sprachlich sehr ansprechend. Mein Sohn fand ihn an vielen Stellen eindeutig besser, denn ""a pig with a wig"" ist beispielsweise  pr√§gnanter als "" ein Schwein mit Per√ºcke"".Daher eine klare Kaufempfehlung, f√ºr alle, die ihr Englisch verbessern wollen, ohne lange Vokabellisten zu lernen. Das Buch zu lesen macht einfach nur Freude."

3953,5,Ottimo,"Fan di Harry Potter della prima ora, letti e riletti i libri in italiano, visti e rivisti i film, iscritta a Pottermore.com, probabilmente sono molto di parte. Amo Harry Potter. Ho deciso di cominciare anche la lettura in lingua originale e confermo che √® scorrevole e piacevole. Io amo l'inglese e conoscendo gi√† molto bene la storia, ne approfitto per cercare di approfondire il pi√π possibile (es. cerco l'origine dei nomi dei personaggi, luoghi, oggetti, che spesso ne rispecchiano l'identit√† stessa), ma lo pu√≤ leggere davvero chiunque.Spedizione veloce, pacco integro e perfetto, il libro √® magnifico.Ora procedo con l'acquisto dei numeri successivi.Compratelo anche voi e fatevi conquistare da Harry!!! :-)"
3954,3,"Buen precio, buen libro... pero env√≠o descuidado","FALLO:Como alguna gente indica, el libro llega con alg√∫n defecto. Esquinas arrugadas, lomo algo manchado, etc.No se si el que los almacena/empaqueta los tira por el suelo o que hace con ellos... pero da muy mala imagen del trato en los productos por parte de los responsables.Sacando este mal detalle, el libro esta genial (la historia).Las tapas tienen un tacto y dise√±o agradable.El precio est√° bien.Por supuesto, es la versi√≥n en ingles. No se porque hay gente que en los comentarios pone que le llega en castellano. Si es fallo de Amazon o de pedirlo mal. Yo no he tenido ese problema."

3959,5,Mai visto niente di piu bello!,"Alla fine mi sono deciso di comprarlo, e devo dire che la lingua originale √® sempre un scalino piu in alto.Pagine belle e spesse, la carta √® sul grezzo quindi molto carina, una bella rilegatura non all'americana.La copertina √® fatta di un materiale fantastico, plastico, che si pu√≤ pulire, dallo sporco o dal'unto. Basta utilizzare della carta assorbente bagnata. il procedimento √®: NON GRATTARE, ma solo bagnare e asciugare, meglio senza sfregare troppo ma non ho riscontrato perdire di colore o altro..fantastica. Non usate troppa acqua per non rischiare di bagnare le pagine, per il resto come vi ho detto, la copertina non si rovina..non si impregna dell'acqua, che attenzione deve serivre solo a inumidire e ammoribidire lo sporco che poi andra tolto con dell'altra carta o un panno asciutto. Et Voil√†, come nuova!"
3960,4,Va bene anche se desideravo una grafica meno giocosa,E' il classico libro di partenza della saga Potter ma in inglese.Richiesto per un ragazzo di prima media che conosce a memoria la storia (libri in italiano e film) ma desidera cimentarsi con l'inglese durante le vacanze (bella idea !).La rilegatura √® morbida e personalmente non amo molto la grafica proposta in copertina ma non c'√® molta altra scelta in inglese.Il prezzo √® pi√π che soddisfacente per quanto proposto.

3966,5,Five Stars,Love it
3967,5,Livello elementare di scrittura che rende la lettura davvero piacevole e assai comprensibile,"Sono doddisfatta del mio acquisto. La lettura √® piacevole e scorrevole: la prima avventura di Harry letta in lingua originale √® ancora pi√ª avvincente. Ne consiglio la lettura a chiunque avesse voglia di esercitarsi con la lingua inglese, oltre che agli amanti del genere. Anche chi ha poca dimestichezza con la grammatica inglese non avr√° grosse difficolt√° nella lettura, poich√© il libro √© indirizzato ad un pubblico molto giovane."
3968,3,Buono ma....,"Ottimo avere un libro a disposizione ovunque in pochi mimuti. Mi √® stato per√≤ impossibile valutare il livello di conoscenza dell'inglese per poterlo leggere e quindi mio figlio (seconda media) non lo legge, per il momento"

3970,4,Fantasy and action united,"As a big Harry Potter fan I must say the book is fantastic. I am from Switzerland and I love the way how J.K Rowling is writing the book. When I compare the movie with the book, I can‚Äôt tell which one is better. Both of them are great ! Here in the Philosopher Stone Harry, who lived with his aunt and uncle since a little kid, gets to know his whole story. He always thought that his parents had died in a car crash. He lived a terrible life with his relatives, but now he will see the truth. Harry learns that his parents died of an attack from one of the best wizards in the world but he survived. All people in this magical world know his name, Harry Potter, the kid who survived. He is talented as a wizard and goes to the school of witchcraft and wizardy, Hogwarts. I think it is a book for everyone who likes fantasy and action."

3990,4,Mein absolutes Lieblingsbuch !,"Hatte die ganzen Harry Potter B√ºcher schon als Kind gelesen undwollte mir nun die Englische Version zulegen.Hab bei meinem Buchh√§ndler vor Ort gefragt, wie teuer das w√§reund nach einem Vergleich auf Amazon habe ich gesehen, dass ich3-4‚Ç¨ sparen konnte. Hab es also hier bestellt.Die Story ist nat√ºrlich grandios und super einfach zu verstehen.Wer einen gewissen Grundwortschatz im Englischen besitzt, derwird damit sicherlich keine Probleme haben und zur Not kann mansich ja noch ein Lexikon daneben legen :)Lieferung war durch Prime flott wie immer.Das Buch selbst ist jetzt von der Verarbeitung her etwas....komisch.Es f√ºhlt sich an als w√ºrde es auf dem Cover voller Staub sein und auchwenn man es mit nem Tuch versucht abzuwischen bleibt dieses staubigeGef√ºhl vorhanden. Des Weiteren habe ich feststellen m√ºssen, dass aufeinigen Seiten die bedruckte Schrift entweder verwischt war, oder anmanchen Stellen teils fehlte.Deshalb ""nur"" 4 Sterne."
3991,5,Cliente abituale,"Ho preso questo libro x mio figlio che frequentando il liceo scientifico,x le vacanze doveva leggere un libro in lingua originale. Abbiamo  fatto una ricerca sul web e Amazon √® risultato il migliore come sempreIo compro spesso da loro perch√© sono seri corretti e rispettano sempre ci√≤ che dichiarano sia come illustrazione dei prodotti che come tempi di consegna.Direi che anche questa volta sono soddisfatta come sempre."
3992,5,Meraviglioso,"Questo libro √® una meraviglia della letteratura contemporanea. Ho iniziato a seguire Harry Potter quando ero solo una bambina: mi ha fatto sognare con la sua magia e mi ha insegnato i veri valori della vita. √à un libro che mi sento di consigliare,per chi ancora non si fosse addentrato in questo mondo, sia a grandi che a piccini. Anche questa versione inglese! Perch√© √® di una scrittura cos√¨ semplice che anche chi ha un po' di difficolt√† con l'inglese con un buono vocabolario vicino potr√† leggerlo! Molto utile anche per chi vuole migliorarlo il suo inglese.p.s. La copertina √® qualcosa di meraviglioso üòç sembra quasi morbida"

3996,5,Lesenswert - nicht nur f√ºr Kinder,"Ich habe mir das Buch gekauft, um mein leicht eingerostetes Englisch wieder ein wenig aufzupolieren. Das gelingt ganz hervorragend, da die Handlung ja (fast) jedem hinl√§nglich bekannt ist. Die fehlenden W√∂rter werden gegoogelt und meine Katze freut sich, wenn ich ihr laut vorlese. Unterm Strich also eine ganz hervorragende Methode, um auch als ""mittelalter"" Mensch mal wieder fl√ºssiger ins Englische zukommen."

4004,5,Good book,"Brand new and in good condition.  Just what I was looking for; a good quality, inexpensive copy of the first book."
4005,4,Geschmackssache,"Ich habe mir dieses Buch geholt um meine Englischkenntnisse zu verbessern.Viele Leute in meinem Umfeld haben mir dazu dieses Buch empfohlen, das es sehr leicht zu lesen sei undbestens f√ºr ""Anf√§nger"" geeignet sei. Prinzipiell kann ich Englisch aber dadurch, dass ich es nicht jeden Tag nutzeist es doch sehr eingerostet.Wer das Buch schon √∂fter auf deutsch gelesen hat, hat hier (meiner Meinung nach) einen riesen Vorteil.Viele W√∂rter habe ich dadurch im Zusammenhang verstanden.Ich vergebe nur 4 Sterne, da ich das Lesen auf englisch wahnsinnig anstrengend finde und das wirklich Geschmackssache ist"

4008,5,Belle √©dition pour un classique √† lire et √† relire,"Cette nouvelle √©dition est r√©ussie, avec une jolie couverture √† la texture √©tonnamment... douce!Le niveau d'anglais est facilement appr√©hensible. Bien que ""l'accent"" d'Hagrid et quelques mots du vocabulaire non courant vous feront parfois tiquer, il est amusant de chercher les correspondances (et diff√©rences) avec la traduction fran√ßaise !En bref, j'ai √©t√© heureux de relire le premier tome d'Harry Potter, pr√®s de 15 ans apr√®s la d√©couverte de la saga (en fran√ßais √† l'√©poque bien s√ªr). Une belle fa√ßon de reprendre la saga sous un tout autre jour lorsque l'on en conna√Æt jusqu'au d√©nouement. Mais vous pourriez √©galement en red√©couvrir des d√©tails oubli√©s."

4010,1,D√©√ßu,Je suis vraiment tr√®s d√©√ßu ! J'ai command√© le livre tout neuf et il ne l'est pas du tout. La couverture est perfor√© par des petits points au milieu et un coin du livre est un peu d√©chir√©. C'est peut √™tre tout petit mais c'est tr√®s important pour moi. J'aimerai demander un remboursement si possible.
4011,4,Satisfaite ... mais,"L'article √©tait en parfait √©tat, tout √† fait conforme √† ce qui √©tait pr√©sent√© par le vendeur.N√©anmoins, les √©ditions Bloombury ont eu la bonne id√©e d'√©diter les 7 tomes d'Harry Potter en 2 formats (petit :17,8 x 11 ; grand :19,8 x 12,8). Il serait donc n√©cessaire d'afficher clairement petit ou grand format pour ceux qui, comme moi, les collectionnent."

4027,5,pure pleasure,"So you've read Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone? Whether you've read it or not, listening to it is delightful. I like to think I know the book pretty well, but listening to it I was able to pick up some details I had glossed over while reading. My children and I like listening to this in the car. It's great to be able to enjoy it as a family.We have heard both Stephen Fry's reading and Jim Dale's reading. Stephen wins our vote hands down. Jim Dale makes Hermione sound too whiny , Ginny Weasley sounds much the same. It is almost as if he is trying too hard to make sure he has a distinct voice for each character (something he has commneted on in interviews). Stephen Fry's reading is just perfect. If you are not accustomed to British accents it may take a little while to get used to it but its worth it."

4037,5,Unbedingt lesenswert,"Ich liebe Harry Potter. Ich liebe die englische Sprache. Da bietet es sich doch an, die Buchreihe um Harry Potter mal in der Originalfassung zu lesen, dachte ich mir.Ich habe mir also direkt ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" auf mein Kindle geladen und komme seitdem nicht mehr davon weg.Es ist einfach zu lesen, weitaus einfacher, als ich es mir vorgestellt hatte - mein Sprachniveau in der englischen Sprache d√ºrfte sich ungef√§hr im B-Bereich bewegen. Man muss also nicht unbedingt ein Englischprofi sein, um hier beim Lesen gut voranzukommen.In der Kindleversion steht einem ansonsten die Option Word Wise zur Verf√ºgung, eine Hilfsfunktion f√ºr Englischlernende, bei der schwierige englische Vokabeln direkt √ºber dem betreffenden Wort erl√§utert werden.Au√üerdem hat man per Klick auf's Wort auch direkt die √úbersetzung zur Hand, was l√§stiges Nachschlagen im W√∂rterbuch √ºberfl√ºssig macht.Zum Buchcover kann ich leider nicht sehr viel sagen, da ich eben nur die E-Version besitze. Die Aufmachung, wie sie die Abbildung zeigt, ist aber meiner Meinung nach sehr h√ºbsch gestaltet.Ich kann das Buch jedem an's Herz legen, vor allem denjenigen, die die Handlung noch gar nicht kennen. Wobei die deutsche Version auch nicht zu verachten ist, beide sind toll geschrieben.Lasst euch verzaubern. It's a kind of magic. ;)"
4038,3,"Obviously a brilliant read, so I'd give it 5 stars but ...","Obviously a brilliant read, so I'd give it 5 stars but it does annoy me that for a children's book, there is no option to buy the Harry Potter series in bigger print, with pictures or even on CD (at a reasonable price).  My son is dyslexic and would love to be able to attempt to read this, but gets muddles too quickly, sore eyes and a headache.  So it's now down to me to act out all the characters, record it and type out in bigger print for him.  It's fine, it's just going to be time consuming!"
4039,5,Ein Buch das jeder einmal gelesen haben sollte!,"Ein tolles Buch! Vor allem wenn man dem Alltag entkommen will und in eine v√∂llig andere, magische und fesselnde Welt eintauchen m√∂chte. Sowohl f√ºr gro√ü als auch f√ºr klein empfehlenswert. Sehr unterhaltsam, lustig und faszinierend."

4052,5,Un libro que marc√≥ mi infancia,"Todav√≠a recuerdo el d√≠a que mi madre nos compr√≥ a mi hermana y a mi este libro. No hab√≠a salido el segundo a la venta y nunca hubiese imaginado que podr√≠amos llegar a donde estamos hoy, 7 libros que han arrasado creando un universo paralelo de magia y un octavo en camino. Cuando cumpl√≠ 11 a√±os y no me lleg√≥ la carta me doli√≥ bastante (sab√≠a que no era posible pero una parte de mi...).Harry Potter y la Piedra Filosofal es una introducci√≥n magn√≠fica. J.K. Rowling ha creado desde cero un mundo tan real que, a pesar de estar basado en ""magia"", te parece que est√°s conviviendo realmente con ellos pero eres un muggle y no te has enterado. Por si fuese poco escribe de forma maravillosa, el ritmo nunca decae, y es una novela que la pueden apreciar tanto ni√±os como mayores porque cada edad profundizar√° en mayor o menos medida en la historia.En su momento los le√≠ en espa√±ol, y ahora me parece estupendo leerlos en ingl√©s brit√°nico (el americano tiene expresiones diferentes), que es el original, y as√≠ nos vamos preparando para cuando salga el octavo libro, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child."

4088,5,My First Harry Potter at age 71!,"I had heard the name Harry Potter for a few years.  For some reason or another I made no attempt to find out what the fuss was all about. Fast Forward 10 years later and I have a set of 10 year old triplets. Harry, Voldemort, Hagrid and the Weasleys were common names I heard.  One night the triplets and their Dad were at my house and we needed a movie to watch. The name Harry Potter came up. I finally said I‚Äôm game and the rest is history. Less than a week ago I fell into Book one:  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer‚Äôs Stone.  There were times I had to make myself put the ebook down. This is one of the best books I have ever read. Now, if you will excuse me, I must return to Platform nine and three quarters for my return to Hogwarts."

4104,5,Ottimo per la lingua,"Ho letto la versione italiana (in generale tutta la saga) pi√π di tre volte ma con l'inglese non sono un granch√®, per questo ho scelto questo libro, per aumentare il numero di termini nel mio vocabolario, cimentandomi per la prima volta nel leggere un libro in inglese aiutato dal fatto di sapere gi√† bene di cosa si sta parlando.Devo dire che √® stata un ottima esperienza sono riuscito a leggerlo tutto aiutandomi a tratti con il traduttore senza grosse difficolt√† e pi√π andavo avanti pi√π mi rendevo conto che la lettura era scorrevole, segno di un progressivo miglioramento (niente di mostruoso ma meglio di niente). Consiglio l'acquisto a chi voglia migliorare il proprio inglese alla prime armi."

4114,5,Perfetto,"Acquistato come libro di lettura in lingua per un ragazzo di 12 anni che conosce bene la grammatica inglese ma deve fare pratica e ampliare il vocabolario e per questo scopo √® perfetto. Il target √® quello, la storia √® appassionante, l'inglese non √® impossibile da comprendere. Per averli letti tutti posso dire che i libri successivi sono via via pi√π difficili, ma questo qui per un ragazzo di seconda media che segue lezioni di inglese dalla prima elementare con profitto √® ideale."
4115,3,"Carino, ma...","Ma non ne consiglio l'acquisto a chi abbia gi√† veduto il film, a meno che non abbia delle ragioni proprie per voler leggere il libro in lingua originale. Il film √® infatti fedele al libro sin nelle minime battute, cosicch√© chiunque abbia visto il film in italiano o a maggior ragione in lingua inglese non ci troverebbe nulla di che. A questo riguardo nutrivo grandi aspettative dal libro: credevo che il film avesse tagliato molto, come in genere accade, invece anche il libro √® molto povero di dettagli e di descrizioni capaci di creare il mondo in cui le vicende sono ambientate, di caratterizzare i personaggi, di consentire al lettore di immedesimarsi nei personaggi, e via dicendo. Naturalmente non mi aspettavo dall'opera la profondit√† di un Tolkien o la fedelt√† agli ambienti di Scott, ad esempio, ma neanche una simile assenza di atmosfera, per cos√¨ dire. Una cosa gradevole del libro che viene totalmente persa nella riduzione cinematografica √® invece lo humor inglese  utilizzato nel descrivere ci√≤ che accade ai protagonisti e ne permea i dialoghi, quindi in tal senso pollice recto."

So infuriating but thankfully we had some roald Dahl ones with us as well to pass the time in the car. Would not recommend.

4140,5,A good foundation for the rest of the books,"This may be my second or third re-read of this first book in the 7 book Harry Potter series.  Still a good read after all these years.  This book was first published in 1997 so its 23 years old.The novel is well written with sympathetic characters, villainous antagonists (House of Slytherin), and a good plot (which is consistent both for the book as well as being spread across 7 books - no one in the story line knows about horcruxes yet).The story and Harry, Ron, and Hermione's skills are still primitive since their ""first years"" at Hogwarts.  Lots of room for growth and mastery.  Still the first appearance of Voldamort was effective, his face on the back of Quirrell's head.  I wonder if Voldamort ever felt about Quirrell's turban the way we sometimes feel about face masks (""I can't breathe"" except that doctor's and nurses where more restrictive face masks every day and seem to do just fine).I'm looking forward to the next book."

4142,5,Now it has become a must-read,"Vividly described event after event, it's already been a while since the story lived with the mind of people of the world.If you want to be part of the world, you want to read at least this very base of Harry Potter series, so you'd understand what your friends, family and media are talking about.I also recommened this story to anyone who wants to learn widely accepted, common and practical English words and expressions."
4143,5,Captivating!,"I absolutely LOVE the Harry Potter series, and it is definitely one of my favorite series that I have ever read.  When I first started reading them I wasn't really sure that I would like them as I had unfortunately thought it was 'nerdy' when I was in school, and it was definitely a huge mistake!  It is still a very good read as an adult, but I really wish that I had started reading them when they came out.  I wanted my kids to be able to experience the magic of Harry Potter while they are young enough to believe in that kind of magic so we have started reading them together, and then watching the movie that coincides with the book.  They love the series as well though I don't think they like it as much as me since my daughter 'teases' me about it.  :)This book is captivating from the very first sentence.  J.K. Rowling is a very gifted writer and is descriptive enough to be able to transport you to her world without being so wordy that you find yourself losing interest.  If you have not read this book yet then read it!  You will not be disappointed."
4144,5,Still amazing,"Amazing doesn't quite fit this book. Though stupendous, inspiring, wonderful and incredible don't quite describe it either it is so much better than all these words put together. If you have not read this book please pick it up. Do not let anyone else's negative opinion keep you from reading this book. It has so much going for it. It's about friendship, bravery, courage, love, family and so many other good things. The magic of Harry Potter has reached all over the world and touched a lot of hearts.Remember ""It is our choices, that decide who we truly are far more than our abilities."""
4145,1,Do not buy it!!!! Zero stars if it was possible.,"Super mad! This book is not put together correctly.  For example, page?  #100 ends and picks back up at page #99. I bought this for my daughters 5th grade class and am super embarrassed.  Editors pick? Seriously?"
4146,3,Much worse condition than advertised,"I purchased this as a used product, so let me start by staying I had no expectation this book would be in perfect condition. The book was advertised as follows ""Condition: Used - Good - Pages and cover are intact. Used book in good and clean conditions. Limited notes/marks and highlighting may be present. May show signs of normal shelf wear and bends on edges..."" When I received the book, the cover was in good condition, but the interior pages were in very poor condition. Forget limited notes/highlights or creased edges...it looks like someone took an x-acto knife and randomly sliced through different chapters of the book in different directions. The first few chapters are barely readable in that condition. It's difficult to turn the pages without them falling apart. The further you get through the book, the better the book's condition gets. If the book's condition was more accurately described, I wouldn't have purchased it."
4147,5,The book that started it all,"This is, of course, the book that launched the multi-billion dollar franchise about the orphaned boy named Harry Potter that finds out he is a Wizard when he turns 10 years old, and has been accepted to Hogwart's School for Witches and Wizards. It would eventually spawn seven books, eight movies, a spin-off series, and a play. For the few who do not know the story, this book basically establishes Harry learning that his parents were Wizards and killed by an evil wizard named Voldemort, who also tried to kill Harry as an infant. The attempt to kill Harry failed, and Harry was sent by Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts to live with his aunt and uncle and then chronicles his first year at Hogwarts where he meets two schoolmates who would become his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermoine Granger.For those who have seen the movie but have not yet read the book, this is the shortest of the novels so it has the least amount of material removed in the movie adaptation. That said, the movie did change some things and did shorten some sequences. For example, the opening sequence with the Dursleys is more extended in the novel and things like the trip to the zoo play out a bit differently than was shown in the movie. But, all the main plot points from the book ended up in the movie, especially once Harry gets to Hogwarts, so that will not be much different.The book is age-appropriate for kids about 10-11 years old and up. Rowling intended that the kids reading it would be about the same age as the characters in the book, so for the first novel around 10-11 years old. The books get increasingly darker and more adult with each new book, but really for this book a kid only really needs to understand the concept of death and ""good guys"" versus ""bad guys"". Otherwise, the novel is pretty tame. It has a good blend of humor, action, and suspense, and touches on themes of family, friends, right vs. wrong, and the like. Even though it is technically a ""kids book"" it is enjoyable enough for an adult, and even though it was written in the mid to late 1990s, it holds up well enough to be enjoyable even years later. It can easily be enjoyed by people in their 20s, 30s, 40s, etc., whether your first experience with the Harry Potter universe was as a young kid, as a teenager, or (as in my case) as an adult because of watching the movies. And, because it is only a few hundred pages and meant for young kids to be able to read it, adults who are fairly quick readers can probably get through it in a couple of days without a problemUltimately, by now anyone reading this likely knows enough about Harry Potter to know the overall story and knows whether they like it or not. But, if you are just getting introduced to the series and are looking at the reviews if you are into fantasy novels or themes like magic, this is definitely worth reading. While it is nowhere near the best book of the series, it does a good job establishing the main characters, telling the stand-alone portion of the story, inviting the Sorcerer's Stone, and setting up what is to come down the line."
4148,1,Harry Potter and the Socerors Stone,The book was written on and not suitable as a gift
4149,5,why didn‚Äôt I read this sooner???,"I never understood why Harry Potter was so popular. I didn‚Äôt get it.So, recently I needed something to watch for background noise while working. I had already watched all episodes of the Office and Psych, so fine, Harry Potter it was.I enjoyed the movie so much I knew the book had to be better. The books are ALWAYS better than the movie.Just finished book one and even though I knew how it ended it was still an excellent read. I laughed. I cried (tears off joy). I entered a world entirely different from my own, yet not really, and it was worth it.I plan to read them all.This book would be safe for preteens/teens as it‚Äôs not really scary. Also, great for homeschooled kids."
4150,1,Mix up,"Unfortunately, this book was linked to the ad for a large print book, but it was just the regular HP scholastic book we have at the middle school I work at.I was quickly refunded my money and was asked to donate the book, so I gave it the the school library."
4151,5,The magic is better than ever in this reread eleven years from my first read,"It goes without saying how awesome this book and the whole following series is. I read this so long ago when the movies were just starting, so I guess my first read of it was in 2010 which was way before I had a Goodreads account.It's just so fun to disappear into Harry's world especially when he escapes the Dursley household for the school year and all his amazing new friends...and some schoolmates who weren't so nice. I remember picturing all the characters, somewhat, but the movies did help enhance the books for me bringing the individual characters to life. This is one book even when reread that you want to be sure you have all day to read, because the same wonderful magic that was there for me the first read was there on an even greater scale for this reread eleven years later (and maybe a few random rereads in between!)"
4152,5,Number 1 in my book collection!,This book now is number 1 in my big book collection! This book was very suspenseful and funny!  ONE of my favorite parts was where he played quidditch! It told about every second of it! I wasn‚Äôt really a big fan of Harry Potter until I started reading the first book! I really recommend reading this! It‚Äôs a magical and suspenseful ride even if you already watched the first movie.
4153,4,Large Print is 16 point,"Well-made book and good price. Large Print Type is 16 point sarif font. We will have to see if this is big enough for my legally-blind son. He may need magnifiers even for this, but easier than the standard print that‚Äôs more like Times New Roman 12"
4154,1,VISUALLY IMPAIRED? DON'T BUY - BEWARE,"This set looks like something you would pick up in the trunk of a car at the flea market.I purchased this set for a friend, put it in a care package, and sent it off to the UK for her.Unfortunately, when she received it, she couldn't tell which disc went where.They're in PEACH and are very hard to read!!!BUYERS BEWARE"
4155,5,"Great book, Great Series","I read this book when I was about 11 years old. I had never read a book harder than the Magic Tree House until I picked this one up, and once I did, I never put it down. This book has humor, good vocabulary, and it's a great experience. I read it again a few days ago and realized just how good these books really are almost 8 years later. I've read the Eragon series, Lord of the Rings, and all kinds of great literature pieces. But this book and this series will always be a classic for me, and I hope that if you read this review as a parent or someone who wants to read this that you give it a shot. I can assure you, this book is great and you won't regret reading this book."
4156,5,Saudade,"A very exciting adventure, even for a 27 year old man. It was even better than I had expected after all these years. I, like many American millennials growing up in the 90‚Äôs, was one of the children who were not allowed to read Harry Potter for illogical beliefs held by their parents. The books were considered evil, and you would be punished or taken to see a counselor if you were caught with one. It is because of this that I read these books most unlike my friends over 2 decades prior in their childhood. The thrill of talking about such an amazing children‚Äôs book with your friends is now lost, no longer to hold the same magic as it once did. In simpler days before we had computers and social media at everyone‚Äôs fingertips, speaking in person with all your friends about all the latest popular things held so much more value than in this day and age. Those were cherished times. So with that being said, no, this book for those like me will never hold a candle to the flame of ages past. But even so, what an amazing feeling it is to read this book. Apart from the usual excitement and suspense, a very different emotion is felt. What can only be described as saudade, a kind of melancholic nostalgia, it makes one wish they could return to a happy time they never got to experience. Thank you for this opportunity to share what my heart has held onto for far too long."
4157,4,"A page turner, fun, nothing transcendent","This was a fun and very fast read.  I believe it was originally written for a younger audience, and it shows, with a lot of transparently silly names for people, places and things.  There is a lot of detail in some aspects, almost none in others.  As escapist fantasy work goes, this is better than most, but I'm not sure I'll read the rest of the series (even though it is set up to encourage exactly that).My question (and this has probably been written about extensively by those more invested in this series than I could ever be):  Why do these folks celebrate Christmas and Easter?"
4158,4,not my favorite series,"it's not as if this is my fave series but Harry Potter is pretty good. my personal favourite in hp would probably be Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.anyways, this book's prologue is about how lily and james, Harry's parents died.then eleven years later, harry received his letter to go to Hogwarts, a magical school.but, as uncle vernon tore it in pieces, harry didnt read the letter.then uncle Vernon got sick of the letters so they went abroad .a giant named hagrid broke in and told harry everything about the wizarding world.fave parts:Hermione : it's wingardium leviosar!Hermione : now I'm going to bed before you get another clever idea to get us killed, or  worse , expelled .thx for reading!"
4159,5,The beginning,"His uncle tries to stop Harry from receiving his acceptance letter from Hogwarts. Nothing can stop the magical invention. All the years of being tormented by the Dursleys doesn't matter as much. Guided by Hagrid into the magical world where he meets Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore and others. He starts his journey to become a wizard and learns about his family. Wonderful story, great characters and situations. Have read the series several times, seen the movies. I liked going back to see what was changed, quite a bit."
4160,5,Best book ever written,"While others may have expressed their love of this book, it is unlikely they could disclose the secret Ms. Rowling carries in her bosom‚Äî-she has the stone! In this day and age, the kind of wealth it can generate would gain the immediate attention of the authorities! Money laundering, drug running, a curse more than a blessing! Jail time, lawyer fees!Thus, the stone gifts her these magical books, to fob off as if written by a muggle. Magic hides in plan sight. Very clever. Very clever indeed!"
4161,3,Easy Read,"The book was easy to read, but clearly not very advanced. With the advantage of knowing what is coming, the ending conversation with Professor Dumbledore almost led me to give the book another star.This is my first time reading these books since maybe 1999, and there isn‚Äôt anything particularly spectacular about this book for me. I am more of an Artemis Fowl fan when it comes to the first book. This book just gets more hype because it builds into a much more powerful overarching story. The Sorcerer‚Äôs Stone, as a stand-alone, was just okay for me. Still a fun, easy read."
4162,5,Starting Harry Potter at age 67,"I have spent my life knowing about Harry Potter, but never once reading the books. Well now it is my time and what fun I've had reading the first book of The Sorcerer' s Stone.  Having seen the movies 3 times each, it was more fun to read the book. Mrs. Rowling's humor in the pages was by far much better in the book and I found myself laughing so hard I found myself with tears. The characters are ones that stick with you and now I will move forward to the next in the series."
4163,5,Large type works great,"We boughgg th this for our 13 year old with Down syndrome. She is a great reader but doesn‚Äôt like to read large books. We found it is because the type is so close snd she loses her place. We used bookmarks and place holders, but only the large print has helped. She loves Harry spotter so it is a definite win!"
4164,1,Honestly boring,"This book isn't very much fun to read. It's a lot of exposition, some overt bigotry, and altogether too many plotlines."
4165,5,HARRY POTTER RULES!!!!!!!,"I am a ten year old girl I started reading the books in second grade because my teacher read the first book as a read a loud I got to the fourth book. (I didnt really understand it but kindof) Then I stopped reading it cause I didn't get it. I started reading it again in fourth grade i just started from the first book cause i didn't remember much, now I just started the fifth book. Harry potter is really good I would recommend it to anyone ten or above."
4166,5,As Amazing As I Thought It Would Be!!,"OK gonna confess here... this was my first time reading Harry PotterüòÖI know I know, ot only took me 20 years...I feel as though I grew up with Harry and his gang since the first movie came out when I was the same age as Harry... I only wish I would've gotten an owl and a letter... sighAnyway I've always loved the movies but I've been wanting to read the books and I'm so head I did! You know the saying.. ""the book was better""‚ù§"
4167,5,Felt the need to re-read it,"Watched the 20th anniversary special and then the first three movie.  Wondered about the differences from the books. Since I had not read them in quite a while decided to read them again.  Reaffirmed that they are different, and in some ways better.  On to the next one!"
4168,5,OMG! Best book ever!,"WARNING! I am very bad at spelling.I have read this book about one million times and it never gets old! I have loved J. K. Rowlings books for... well... forever.As the first book in a sieres you really have to get the readers hooked. Not just with the first chapter, but with the whole first book! If readers don't like the first chapter, they probably will not read the rest of the book. If you get the readers hooked with the first chapter but not the first book, they probably will not read the second one.When you read the first chapter of this book, you will deffinetly get hooked. BUT, when you read the first book and say ""I love this book! I can't wait to read the second one!"" you hace gotten hooked not by the first chapter, BUT by the whole first book!There is SO much more I want to say about this book but I would probaly give away too many spoliers. I will just let you find out the secrets of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Sorceres Stons yourself!"
4169,5,ABOUT 10TH TIME READING THIS,"This book really holds up to repeated reading. All I have to do is let several months go by and I can reread it with almost fresh enjoyment. I think I will buy the paperback version soon. There are only a few of the Harry Potter books that I really enjoy, and this is one of them. In my opinion, a good book is better than most movies. RECOMMENDED FOR ALL THOSE WHO HAVE, AND HAVE NOT READ THIS BOOK BEFORE."
4170,5,rereading series forth time,Very well written and  good introduction  to characters both magical.  Since I was educated in  both US schools. In Spain as well as a girls boarding school in Hunts I felt a kinship with new students learning the ins and outs of a new and complex building and having different teachers for each subject.  Left after completion of O levelx.  Reybturnn to  US college/_u nversibtd
4171,5,Terrific,"I am 27 years old and this is the first time I've read any of the Potter books. I decided to read this after having my daughter and needing something to do at night during nursing sessions. This book did not disappoint. It was always intertaining, was a easy read, and I would recommend it to anyone. Thank you J. K. R!"
4172,5,Classic,Harry Potter was the first series of books that showed me how magical the world of reading can be. It will always hold a special place in my heart as the years go on. Each chapter brings such nostalgia when reading now and it is something that I'm able to share with my own children. Harry teaches us that no matter what your circumstances are you can come together with your friends and make the impossible happen.
4173,5,I'm sort of doing this backwards.,I've seen the movie. Now I'm reading the books. The book is just as magical as the movie. Well of course you say. It's all about the magic. But J.K. Rowling was very much involved with the movie filming. It does help with giving the characters voices. This is great fun.
4174,4,"Nice, but expensive.","Really love Harry Potter and wanted to try out the audio CDs while driving to and from work (I get tired of listening to music). Unfortunately, these CDs are expensive so I only bought the first one. Overall, I like it, but I don‚Äôt like that the end of each CD often stops in the middle of a chapter. You would think that they could plan it better so that the end of each CD ends as closely to the end of a chapter as possible. It‚Äôs hard to remember what‚Äôs going on during the time that you have to switch CDs and especially if you have to stop it for later. Love the narrator! He is awesome."
4175,4,Will The Last One to Read the Book Please Shut off the Lights?,"At the time I write this, there are some 5,512 Amazon reviews written about J.K. Rowling's HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, and while not all of them are to the point (there are grumblings about shipping, for instance), there's not much more I can say to persuade or dissuade someone to read this book.  Indeed, although I am sure there are still many first-generation readers to come after me, I do feel like I'm the last person to get around to this book.  Indeed, not having even seen a Harry Potter movie, I'm a complete neophyte.As with some other books I've reviewed on Amazon, I've read this first Harry Potter entirely because my daughter wanted it read to her.  (Mind you, she's already read it many times over herself, could tell if I made a gaffe in my reading, and in fact was sure to point it out in every instance.  Moreover, she took offense at my growling, slightly Scottish accent for Hagrid.  I can't help it if his dialect as written sounds a wee bit Highlander to me.)So, for all those Muggles (i.e., regular dudes, squares, laobaixing, what Rugrats become) who haven't read HP/SS (to use the fandom lingo, or HP/PS, if you're reading the original British version, HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE), here's the upshot: Harry Potter, the son of a pair of heroic wizards is deposited on the doorstep of his wretchedly Muggle aunt, uncle and cousin, the Dursleys, where he's forced to live as a Muggle in a dirty cubby under the stairs and is regularly mistreated throughout his childhood.  When it comes time for him to go off to middle school, Harry, who, as it turns out, is famous in the magic world, escapes from the Dursleys to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  The rest of this volume recounts Harry's first year at Hogwarts, including his making friends, his success at the game of Quidditch, and his encounter with the evil being said to have killed his parents, Voldemort.It's a charming read.  (You probably think I'm being sarcastic; I'm not.)  I won't get into the argument as to whether or not it's truly literature.  Children adore the book, and a lot of adults as well.  I must admit that I found Harry taking a bit too much delight in the suffering of his enemies to make me feel comfortable about him being a role model of any sort to my daughter; then again, Harry went through a childhood guaranteed to keep a Muggle child in therapy for years to come.  As far as my daughter is concerned the bad kids simply deserved it."
4176,5,Harry Potter & The Librarian of Northeast Reston,"The last few days, I've decided to re-introduce myself to the JK Rowling's Harry Potter novels. You probaly know that when a topic has the scent of controversy about it, the Christian fundamentalists (far more conservative than my personal religious leanings) usually make some sort of stink about it. I have seen this trend for most of my life: TSR's Dungeons and Dragons games, Scorcese's Last Temptation of Christ--heck, I even remember hearing a sermon preached about Pac-Man, and about Ravel's Bolero. Over the years, I've come to decide for myself, with Judi's opinion mattering greatly of course, what is (or is not) appropriate for my eyes, or my children's. So, in 2001, I picked . This was 10 years ago, to this very month, when Daniel was in first grade. I wanted to see all the fuss for myself. I wanted to introduce Daniel to a genre I loved and, maybe deep inside myself, I wanted to disrespect the decrees of the fundamentalist Morality Cops just a little bit.You probably know the plot of the Potter novels. You've probably seen the films, swore loudly as you stepped on the Lego pieces in the dark, and maybe you've even bought the vibrating Nimbus 2000 broomstick--it was pulled from Toys 'R' Us shelves, when an alarmed public realized more naughty adults were buying them for themselves than for their children.I need not have bothered worrying about the Morality cops. Rowling is an amazing writer (Her name, by the way, rhymes with Bowling, not Prowling). I knew, going into the series, that the story was about a boy wizard. I did not expect her adeptness at setting a tone. Take, for example, the opening sentence of this famous novel: ""Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much."" With less than 25 words, she captures the attention of the reader, sets a stage, and divides her world into two camps: those who are normal, and those who were not. She employs a light irony in her narrative that neither mocks the reader nor her characters. Moreover, this was Rowling's first novel. Each character introduced--the boorish Dursleys; Hagrid, the hairy motorcycle-riding giant; Professor Dumbledore (a Merlin/Gandalf analogue, if there ever was one); and thin-lipped Professor Minerva Macgonagall, followed by the hero of the series, who is maltreated by his Aunt and Uncle.We follow the young lad as he meets the wizarding world, and is accepted into Hogwarts, Britain's foremost school of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and confronts the malevolent Lord Voldemort, who created such havoc at the time of Harry's birth that the magic community still refers to him as ""You-Know-Who."" Her sentences are usually pitch perfect, and she has an uncanny way of blending genres with excellent writing.A word about genre literature in general, and fantasy literature in particular: it is no stretch to find other series (Machale's Pendragon series, and Riordan's Percy Jackson and the Olympians series both spring to mind) written for young adults, where a young person of unknown magical powers are introduced to a world with an evil overlord that only he may slay. I'm okay with this: it's the mark of genre literature, in the style 12th-century heroic balladeers. The story isn't the plot, so much as how it is told.I think I'm letting my head get in front of my fingers a bit as I type, so let me rephrase: genre literature is supposed to be fixed in form. Potter falls neatly into the heroic category, as well as fantasy genre, as well as the bildungsroman (coming-of-age novel). I say this because we expect genre literature to fall inside a genre. We expect Harry to confront The Dark Lord, and probably to lose Dumbledore along the way (in much the same way as George Lucas penned his Star Wars series). We expect him to find allies along the way, and for Potter to make enemies. Rowling does something substantially more: she writes her characters skillfully and believably, in every single page. Harry Potter and his friends are comfortable in their genre skin, in an unforced manner. Hermione is now a famous name because the frizzy-haired, brainy 11-year-old witch was written with letter-perfect precision. Many other authors of Young Adult fiction fail at the same task Rowling set for herself.I can think of no better endorsement for Rowling and her work than the following anecdote. My son Daniel was unable to read his own name at the beginning of first grade. By Christmas day of that same year, he had completed the first two Harry Potter novel. Say what you will about the witchy, supposedly-non-Christian values of her magical world, she taught my son to read. His blinders were lifted and it set him on a lifelong track that makes this librarian not only proud, but amazed. A person rarely gets to see literacy actually happen in a person. I have JK Rowling, and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, to thank for that gift."
4177,5,This is pog,"ive read the whole harry potter series numerous times and i am doing it again and am currently in the middle of the deathly hallows,wont spoil anything but i cry every time i read the last 3 books ;-; this was an AMAZING SPECTACULAR SERIES THAT EVERYONE MUST READ AND IF THEY DONT LIKE THE FIRST ONE THATS OKAY BECAUSE IT GETS BETTER AFTER THE FIRST TWO BOOKS SO READ ALL OF THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS"
4178,5,The hype is real,There's a nostalgic feeling of a carefree teen that is brought out by certain memories. A great example is me Playing Zelda: the ocarina of time on a saturday morning while getting pampered by my mom.This book has an unusual ability take the reader and place them at Hogwarts flying in brooms and casting spells. The pages became alive and the characters seemingly jumped in and out the imagination. I have to admit that the hype is real and JK is on a class of her own when it comes to YA. This book is incredible.
4179,5,One of the best books I've read in a very long time.,"Honestly I didn't know what to expect reading this book, I never watched any movies and I never really heard much from friends. Although they did make me take the house quiz. (Now a proud hufflepuff). But man, I was missing out. I've only spent a little under a week reading it because I was hooked, I always loved magic in stories but this book went all in. But most importantly, besides the houses and spells and even the magic itself, Rowling is an impressive writer. I solely believe that it's not just a good idea that makes something great, it's the execution behind it, and she is proof of that. By Showing and not telling she made all of the spells more magical, and there was always something so interesting on every page. If you like magic and good writing, you'll love this book."
4180,5,Fantastic!,"I LOVE these Harry Potter CDs. They are unabridged (not shortened versions) with JIM DALE reading the books and doing all the voices. He is FANTASTIC! Love to listen in my car while driving, it really makes an awful commute go quickly, as I get lost in the stories. I am much less stressed when I arrive at my destination!"
4181,5,I like the larger print,I love this book. So excited it is in a larger print for my 10 year old to read.
4182,4,"Wrong product, FANTASTIC customer service","Even though what I received was two paperback books and what I ordered was two AUDIO books, I am still giving this review 4 stars, and here is why:First off, I was very excited to listen to these ""books on tape"", as I have never done that before; I much prefer to read a book in hand.  I've heard good things, however, and will soon be traveling, so I was excited at the prospect.  I was very disappointed to open my package and find paperback books (at audio prices) and the cynic in me expected to be out of luck.However, within short hours of sending my email, I got a reply from the company, expressing their apologies, explaining that they are out of stock of what I ordered, and that I am free to keep the books or donate them as I see fit.  My account was credited the money spent IMMEDIATELY and no further problems arose.If you ask me, in an age when we can do everything online, we get snotty and expect more than we should.  Mistakes happen, I am okay with that, just fix it - and this company did, right away.  Much more than I expected and shame on me for that.  Good for them, would order from them again."
4183,3,The audio was great but the cd's were poorly printed in some kind ...,"The audio was great but the cd's were poorly printed in some kind of pale orange color.  I assumed that maybe the screen printing was not completed.  I could not read the information on the cd's.  The box was in great shape.  I just wish I could read the cd's to know which came first, second, third, etc.  Had to try each cd in order to find the first cd."
4184,5,On the bandwagon,"Okay, so I have to admit two things: one, I'm fast approaching 40 and  don't have any children; two, I read this book just to see what all the  fuss was about; three, I loved it.I'd heard of Harry Potter of  course, but didn't think much of it until all the fuss over the fourth  book. People I work with began telling me I should read it and they were  right.  The book reminded me of the works of Roald Dahl.  I don't think  small children should read it alone, but that makes it perfect for reading  together.  I really enjoyed the interplay of the three main characters - I  thought it was cool that they were at once simple enough for children to  understand and complex enough for adults to find interesting  too.There are plenty of reviews which divulge part of the story, so  I won't waste your time with a plot synopsis other than to say that I  watched Silence of the Lambs with very few surprises, guessed the secret of  Sixth Sense fifteen minutes into the movie, and got surprised by the ending  of this book.  I really enjoyed this book and I can't wait to get the next  three (two of which are currently on back-order - hazards of being a  bandwagon fan I guess)."
4185,5,Needed 1 book in hardback,Volume 1 was the o my one of the set I didn‚Äôt have in hardback so ordered to complete the set. Great for reading to children who love this type of story but not yet reasy to self read. By the time we get to volume 3 I won‚Äôt be able to get him away from the book!
4186,5,The first of a great series,"Like any first book of a series it usually is the hardest to get into, due to the fact that you know little to nothing about the book. This was the hardest book to read of the series, even after seeing the movie and then reading the book. But it is not the best book of the series but I can't say it is the worst either. I don't think any of the books can be labled 'worst'. This book and the second book hold unique places within the series, for everything is being build on these two and the ball starts rolling in the third book (The best of the series, along with the Goblet of Fire), the ball is rolling and we know the characters and we know what to expect at times, but at the sametime she keeps up suspensful as to what really is going to happen and keeps us in the dark about the next book.This book is an introduction to the characters, like meeting anyone for the first time it takes a little while to get acquainted, this is why I think book three is the best, we are fully acquainted and they are good friends.But nonetheless, this is a good book and better to read the second time."
4187,5,the beginning of a magical series !!!,"Jk Rowling is amazing , I am a life long reader ,biographys, history, politics,clasics, mystery's ,ect ect .One of rhe great joys of my life was reading to my children , I started reading this to them aloud, and I was hooked ,so were they !!!! We continued on with the series, standing in line at ,midnight for the next book !!!!! In August !!!!  ANYONE who can get children to want to read a book so much during summer vacation deserves a medal !!!! What a wonderful time we had !!! I must admit by the time the last one came out,my kids were in college, that did not stop me from standing in line at the bookstore at midnight for my copy, I was pleased to see I was not the only one with white hair !! But it filled me with joy to see all the age groups there waiting for a BOOK and talking about the last one ,speculating about the new release !! THANK YOU JK ROWLING for your wonderful world of Harry Potter !!!"
4188,4,Kid friendly,"Reading this for the first time as an adult and while it was cute and a easy read it is definitely too young for me. I'm a keep going through the series,cause I know it gets better"
4189,5,A world of wonderment,"My daughter, a teacher and mother of my first grandchild, encouraged me to read the Harry Potter series so when the youngster is of the reading-to age, I would be prepared.  To that end, she gave me the entire set.  Beginning at the beginning, I opened the Sorcerer's Stone and became hooked.  This is great stuff, and as a senior citizen I highly recommend it for the ubiquitous children ""of all ages.""  I can see why it takes Ms. Rowling so long to write one of these adventures:  It must take months to come up with all the delightful names of people and objects and to create the wizardry world of Hogwarts (see what I mean about names!), plus the traditions and games and history of this other world.  And yes, even though it is fantasy, I predict you will be caught up in the spells she weaves.  This is a book of mini-adventures, which - except for the principal mystery - conclude within a few fast-moving pages.  I believe this is an important factor to keep children interested.  There is suspense and some scary stuff, but most of it is over in a paragraph or two.  And there's humor that kids will laugh out loud at.  This is a book that is populated with great characters that children can identify with.  They range from Harry, the put-upon orphan who becomes a hero, to Hermione the bookish girl who earns her place among the boys, to Neville the diminutive lad who just naturally lags behind as he is constantly looking for his lost toad.  There's even Hagrid, a gentle, and not too smart, giant.  If you've got a child about nine who won't be motivated to read, I suggest you just leave a couple of these Potter books lying around without comment.  Chances are good that the child might just pick one up, after all Harry is totally awesome among the young set.  Once reaching the second page, the child will forget about the fact he/she ""hates to read."""
4190,5,Amazing,I chose this rating because of how this book made me feel personally and the settings. They send you to Hogworts where you get sent to Hogworts and turn in to a wizard/witch. I also love how you can just lose yourself in in this book. I really think that J.K. Rowling made a real master piece  when she made this book.
4191,2,Not a 1997 First Edition,This was not a first edition. This print is a copyright of 1999 which is 2 years after first print. It also lists the second book Chamber of Secrets.Apart from that it is a cool edition and the book is in great condition. the pages are pristine.
4192,5,Yes it's for adults too!,"After having read all four Harry Potter books three times each I am going through withdrawal. I wish I didn't have to wait a year or more for the next book so I bought the two schoolbooks. Of all the books I have read as an adult I have found some of the greatest reading joy in Harry Potter. Those of us who grew up as nerds, unathletic, and/or non-cliquey people will feel at home at Hogwarts. Those readers who haven't will still love reading these books. As each book unfolded I saw parallels between the Hogwarts world and the Star Wars films. Both promote a sense of  a loner learning to thrive in a world where you are just a little bit (or maybe more than a little) different from everyone else. Harry is creative, intelligent, and interesting You will find yourself rooting him on as each book finds him confronting evil and I'm not going to spoil anything by saying any details! Don't skip these books because  you consider yourself a ""grown-up"" and too adult to read them."
4193,5,Harry the First - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"A couple of months ago, I asked my ten year old grandnephew Joe what he'd been reading lately.  He proceeded to tell me about an unbelievable game called 'Quidditch', a wondeful place called 'Hogwarts', and an out of place  but very special person, Harry Potter.OK, it's not Tolkien, Tolstoy,  Shakespeare, Gabaldon or Uris.  J.K. Rowling communicates a remarkable  perception of childhood fears, and the abdurd, out of place, self-defensive  nature of early teenagers in an upsetting, unknown, uncertain and very  dangerous world.Sorcerer's Stone is a fun read, replete with magical  family heirlooms, talented sturigiforms and other family 'pets', plot  twists that are interesting and unexpected, and solid, growing friendships  between characters of very different age, size, likes, personalities and  abilities.Remarkably, diversity and respect for the individual play a  strong part in this and later Harry Potter adventures.  Harry gets pushed,  but doesn't push back too hard.  His response to negative people and events  is to wonder why, not to strike out - even when facing a deadly  enemy.The recommendation for 9 to 12 year olds must be based entirely on  the reading level, rather than the content.  Adult readers will enjoy  Sorcerer's Stone as a relaxing 'between book' as much as young readers  enjoy it as recreational reading.But beware! If a group of kids sees you  reading this book, expect to be quizzed on every detail!"
4194,5,This set of books are awesome!,This set of books and the movies have been read and reread and the movies watched several times a year since they were first out. Our 11 year old son at the time went all the way from NC to Disney World listening to the audio books and didn‚Äôt even want to stop to eat. I‚Äôve just bought them for my Kindle and I‚Äôm almost 70 years old. They are a wonderful addition to book and movie libraries!
4195,5,I love this book.,"I love this book.  This is my second time reading it.  I read it the first time in paperback but never finished the series, so I wanted to start again.  Harry and the rest of the cast are a lot of fun to read about.  Makes you want to be there yourself."
4196,5,Fantastical.,"If you are not a kid, don't worry, you will still enjoy this book and this book is still for you.  Once you start this book it is very hard to put it down because after the first 20 or so pages you know that this story has  what it takes to be a long and involving epic.  Author J.K Rowling slowly  unravels one mystery after another about our main character Harry Potter.  Plus there are all sorts of wonderful and interesting characters that  everyone will enjoy.The themes in this book are good for kids and  adults.  For kids, it will relate to them because it illustrates what it's  like to grow up and how hard it can be to fit in.  For adults, there are  slightly deeper themes, and it will remind you of being young again.  But  in any case this is a story for the young at heart.Bottom line:  Anyone  with an imagination will fall into this story.  And once you're finished,  there are more Harry Potter Books waiting to pull you in.  EXCELLENT."
4197,5,Great Book for the Young and Old Reader,"This book definitely lives up to all the movie and media hype. J.K. Rowling is brilliant and Stephen Fry is thrilling. We decided to listen to these on audio-book while driving, cleaning and working, watching the first movie afterwards. The storyline is engaging and enthralling from the beginning. Magic begins almost immediately, quickly pulling the audience into the mysterious life of Harry Potter. Stephen Fry is capable of a wide range of voices; just when you think he can't possibly read as another new character, he excitingly does it. We worried we might be too old to enjoy this series, but Rowling is such a genius author that she writes at a level enjoyable to all ages. Bravo! Read this book and then watch the coinciding film. The movies never please every fan, especially the hardcore ones, but it's always great to see the characters come to life in cinema."
4198,5,Hardcover collection 1-7,As a fellow Harry Potter fan I wanted my own collection of books. So I bought the set in hardcover. It was cheaper buying each individual book. Only thing bad to report of the books I wish they would have protected them in the box. Nothing was bent or ripped but it made me nervous. Also no missing pages or chapters in my collection. Overall happy customer. Wish you happy reading
4199,3,My first Harry Potter book.,"Colorful characters, easy to follow magic, and a twisting tale of intrigue. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this."
4200,5,Great reading of a great book,"I had already read all four of the available Harry Potter books before I listened to the audio versions of the same books.  (I borrowed the tapes from a friend).  The books impressed me as some of the best writing and storytelling I have ever read, and the audio versions do justice to the writing.  The reader, Jim Dale, is an award-winning actor who makes the writing come alive.  (Although he does pronounce Hagrid differently from the way I do.  Is it ""Hay-grid"" or ""Hag-rid""?)  The CD's and tapes are unabridged, so the listener doesn't miss a word of Rowling's great writing.I often drive solo, and really enjoy listening to talk rather than music.  The Harry Potter audio series is perfect for an interesting diversion from miles of straight freeway.  If you are traveling by car with children, these audio versions of the books could make your trip much more enjoyable.These CD's are expensive, which is why I bought only one at first.  I intend to get a new one with each Amazon order until I own the entire set."
4201,5,"Seniors read Harry Potter, too!","When the first Harry Potter book went on sale, I purchased the softcover edition. I didn't know whether I would enjoy a ""children's book"" enough to buy the next one in the series. Once I opened the book, however, I hated to put it down when I had to stop reading. I have continued to pre-order the hardcover editions as soon as they were available, so to make a matching set, I recently purchased a harcover edition of ""...The Sorceror's Stone."" I am an old lady, 69 this year, a blogger and a self-published author of my own fantasy story. I love Rowling's writing, though I am sometimes surprised at how dark and dangerous the plot can become. But her readers are not to be coddled: bad things do happen, and they can't always be fixed by ""magic."" The first book in the Harry Potter series is a must-have, in my opinion, especially if you joined the readership late or have only seen the movies."
4202,5,Still the best story,"I love the potter series. Warm and engaging, it was so fun to read with my children uears ago, and it still holds my attention and warms my heart all these years later. I love this series."
4203,5,I'm hooked!,"Afer hearing of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone as being either 1) a great children's book or 2) something akin to a witches' bible, I bought this book, as so many others have done, simply to see what all the Harry  Potter hype was about.  As a middle-aged adult whose taste in books ranges  from literature to history to current events, may I say that I have seldom  enjoyed a book as much as this one.  I wonder if the benighted people who  condemn JK Rowlings as guilty of promoting Satanism also pass the same  verdict on Hans Christian Anderson and the Brothers Grimm.  The book was  fun, fantasy, and pure escapism, and that is all it sets out to be.  On all  three counts, it succeeds brilliantly.  I finished the first book yesterday  and am looking forward to reading the sequels... hopefully, all six.  Kudos  to Rowling for creating an instant -- and enduring -- classic for all ages.  (Now if I could just get hold of a real Nimbus Two Thousand.....)"
4204,5,Addicting!,"It's not the characters or the plot that makes this fabulously entertaining, it's the genius of J.K. Rowling.She is extremely funny (her sense of humor really shines in the later installments) and has an incredible imagination. Her writing is masterful. She weaves a very light, funny, and engaging story.Her characters are lovable, the settings are extraordinary (you'll want to jump right into the book and walk alongside Harry) and the ending leaves you breathless and panting for more.This is not your typical ""good guy vs. bad guy"" plot in kiddie book form. This is J.K. Rowling's world. Young and old, male and female, doesn't matter. She has a universal audience.I loved this book so much that I going to splurge on a collector's edition for myself. It's THAT good.Mark my words, YOU WILL BE HOOKED TOO!CrisP.S. Pick up the tapes and read along. You'll have a double dose of pleasure and Jim Dale is terrific with the voices."
4205,5,"Wizards, witches and wart hogs or Hogwarts?",I have eead this book multiple times at this point. I wnjoy it each and every time and am constantly amazed at the fresh feel for each time.Even though it is familiar it is always satisfying to know that stories are still told that are so worth repeatingIf you've read it you already know. If you haven't  you should.Great writing and story telling for all ages.
4206,5,The Boy Who Won Us All Over,"I grew up reading this series. It was the first full book I ever read, and even now that I'm over thirty, it still makes me happy and keeps me smiling the whole time I read it. Author may be a crappy person, cause she is, but this is still one of the best book series I've ever read. Terrible people do awesome things all the time I suppose."
4207,5,the start of the best book series ever harry potter,"this is the 1st book of the most captivating fun,imaginative,best book series harry potter this is where you learn about harry and why he has a scar the shape of a lightning bolt on his forehead you also learn all about the very different characters through out the story with fun,imagination,great adventures,a pesty poltergeist,the funny humor within the books,the hogwarts ghost,the headmaster albus dumbledore,all the professors and students,all the different corridors,talking potraits,magical classrooms,staircases that move,the vanishing step,and all the things that lurk around every corner and in the forbidden forest and the giant gameskeeper of hogwarts hagrid i escape to all this places and leave the real world behind and escape on platform 9 3/4 to hogwarts a fun imaginative amazing book that everyone should read take from me the biggest harry potter fan ever."
4208,5,Great narration!,"We bought this to listen on our family road trip since it would be kid appropriate. My husband and I are not usually book-on-tape people, but this had us hooked! Made the drive fly by. The narration is very good! The characters voices are so similar to the actors from the movie, which makes it so much easier to visualize."
4209,5,A Classic !!,I have been a reader of Harry Potter since I was in Junior High and now that I have followed Harry on his journey to the very end I still find myself rereading this book series every now and then.The storytelling By JK Rowling is excellent for any reader seeking fun filled adventure By Harry and his schoolmates.I have had most of these books in paperback and some of them in hardcover over the years and I find that books do wear and tear.I have slowly started recollecting these books again but now all of then will be in hardcover instead of paperback.I do hope someday I can read this to my children as a bedtime story and see the happiness that comes from them while listening to the story.Any child or adult will love Harry Potter And The Sorcerers Stone!!
4210,5,Excellent Kindle Version,"This rating is about the Kindle edition of this book.  I give it five stars for an excellent transfer to the Kindle.  First, if there were any typographical errors, I missed them.  Second, the graphics at the beginning of each chapter appear in the Kindle edition, and look great.  Finally, the book has an active table of contents, allowing me to jump to the chapter of my choice.Since writing this review, I have read through the first five books on my Kindle.  My comments above apply to all five.I read this book on both my Kindle and on my Android using the Kindle application.  My comments apply to both.I also give the book, in any format, five stars for Ms. Rowling's clever use of existing legends and mythology in a highly entertaining story."
4211,5,The best series ever,The start to one of the greatest magical tales of all time. The Harry Potter series should be required in schools it's such a great series of books. This first book (hardcover) came in great shape no damage to the cover or anything
4212,5,HP always good,"While not a master writer as proven by other books besides the HP series, the world the J K R invented is rich and imaginative. Even after numerous reads, it can still hold attention and you can find new tie bits along the way."
4213,5,Unsurpassed,Every now and then I read these books again and love them as much as the first time I read them.  Revisiting Harry Potter stories is like getting together again with the best of old friends. Truly a gift to readers everywhere.
4214,5,I was hanging on every word!,This book is more detailed than the movie. It‚Äôs good to get into the character‚Äôs heads and know what they are thinking. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed watching the movie.
4215,5,Hardcovers are too heavy!,"Wonderful book, obviously. But reader beware that these hardcover versions are extraordinarily heavy. My kid and I each, separately, strained our shoulders reading this book. Bought the rest of the series in paperback."
4216,5,I forgot how much I love this story,I truly forgot until my niece said she wanted the books and I decided to read them again. It has been over 20 years since I‚Äôve read these I think. Loved them then and still love them now.
4217,5,Favorite Beginning,I so love this story. I was forbidden to read this series some time ago but I defied the rules and got into the story. This series started me on the path to writing my own books.
4218,5,it's really five stars,"Has anyone noticed that those who review this book at three stars or less and REALLY MEAN IT cannot spell, or put a sentence together?To those who think the characters are too simple, I'd just point out that one man's  piece of cardboard is another man's archetype. And I can't see how you can  argue that Snape, in particular, is all good or all bad.To those who  think it's no good because it ""isn't any better than"" C.S. Lewis,  Madeleine L'Engle, Edward Eager, Lewis Carroll, Norton Juster, Roald Dahl,  or whomever--this is a little strange. If it's only ""as good as""  the work of these other writers, that means it's EXCELLENT. And a lot of  the kids who are caught up in the Harry Potter phenomenon are bound to  discover these other writers' books. (This is a good thing.)To those who  feel that Slytherin is an evil house, I really think you're making an  unwarranted inference. Harry didn't want to go into Slytherin because he'd  heard too many dark wizards came out of it, but he is sensitive to this  because of his parents' deaths. So far we've had 3-4 unsympathetic  Slytherin characters, out of the 200 or so in that house. I'd be willing to  bet that Rowling will eventually give us a sympathetic Slytherin  character!And to those who are afraid of its ""un-Christian""  overtones: I think rather than keep this book from your kids you'd do  better to teach them the difference between fantasy and reality."
4219,4,I‚Äôve seen the movies.,"I‚Äôve seen the movies, now reading the books.  One thing I learned is the Centaurs knew the future about Voldemort was going to kill Harry before anybody else did.  I look forward to reading the rest and see what else I learn."
4220,5,Amazingly good,"As an adult, reading these books for the first time, I can honestly say I was entertained and surprised by plot developnent and novel execution. While directed towards children, Rowling treated her young readers like adults, neither patronizing demeaning toward children.I wish Ms. Rowling would write a book about how she went about  developing and writing these books."
4221,5,"Harry Potter, best series ever!","To date, this is the fifth time I have read this series.  I love these books and am so glad my daughter encouraged me to read them when they first came out. As a librarian, I was encouraged to read them so that I could recommend them to my students in middle school. This is a classic adventure of the first rate; not so much about witchcraft as about good vs. evil and who wins in the end. I would encourage kids of all ages to read them."
4222,5,Just as good the second time.,I've read this book before and I'm just as impressed with the author as I was the first time. I'm going to read the sea one next and continue until I've re-read the entire series.
4223,4,Harry potter,Love my Harry Potter collection the only downside is the packaging they don‚Äôt come in CD disks they come in cardboard sleeves which will ruin your CD after so many times of taking it out and putting it back in I would say they‚Äôre also a little overpriced also
4224,5,Suspense,Is good from the beginning to the end. Can't wait to read the rest. I really didn't think I was going to like it. But once I started reading I couldn't put down.
4225,5,I Really Enjoyed all These Books a Lot!,These books are very well written and interesting.  They fill in a lot of extra information and details that are not included in the movies.  I would definitely read them again in the future.  I purchased the Kindle versions which are priced at a great deal also.
4226,5,Delightful,"I came late to the Harry Potter phenomenon, but this book was my first step in becoming an absolute fan, despite my being a Muggle.  I love how friendship, wits, and love work to conquer all.  Fantastic series, highly recommend."
4227,5,Delightful even for a Muggle to read!,"My son read all the Harry Potter books as they were published, but I did not. As a Muggle, I was working and did not set aside the time to read them. I saw the movies as they came out, though, and I enjoyed them.I asked my son how the movies stood up to the books. He said that they followed the books closely.Recently I got the chance to read the first book on my Kindle for free. I downloaded it. I expected to begin it and get bored. After all, I've seen the movie, right?But I suggest, those of you who have done the same, do give the book a read.There are little details here and there that give you more depth into the story and characters.As a Muggle, though, I don't understand why Rowling made the Dursleys so awful. Perhaps to make them less one dimensional would take up too much space or time in the story...."
4228,5,Wonderful!,I loved the movies and finally picked up the book and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. I have to say I enjoyed the book almost better. Every page had me engaged all the way to the end. JK Rowling‚Äôs is an amazing storyteller and can‚Äôt wait to read the rest of the series.
4229,5,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,Thank you for the book. I received it a week early and now my grandson will enjoy this treasure. I will be getting the rest as he reads this book.
4230,5,A must read,"As the first book in the Harry Potter story, this is essential readingThe delightful intersecting of fact an fiction is always excitingIf you believe in magic, in any form, this book is for youEnjoy"
4231,5,"great book, great audiobook","I have been hugely impressed with all four HP books, so I bought the audiocassette to see whether I could get my husband hooked. We listened to  the first half on a long car trip, and I think it worked.  Jim Dale does a  wonderful job of reading, differentiating each character in a different,  and very characteristic, voice. (Apparently he's had to use 400+ voices for  HPIV!)I was surprised to find how much I gleaned from Dale's reading  even after reading Sorceror's Stone several times. The slower pace and  different emphases of reading aloud highlight points that are easy to miss  in a silent reading. Also, hearing the Scots burr of Prof. McGonagall and  Hagrid's regional accent (Lancaster? Somerset?) serve to bring out aspects  of their characters that were less apparent to this American reader."
4232,5,Dale's Performance Extraordinary,"In reviewing the cassette edition earlier, I neglected to mention the incredible performance of Mr. Dale - which is what prompted me to review the edition in the first place!While encouraging kids to read is, of  course, hugely important, the performance by Mr. Dale is so entertaining  that it warrants purchasing BOTH the book and the cassette editions for  your children. The many characters are easily identifiable with Mr. Dale's  wide range of British/Scottish accents, and they are brought to life by his  treatment. As well, Americans will appreciate hearing the proper  pronounciation of ""Her-MY-oh-nee"" (not ""Hermy-WON"") and  other British names. I'm very impressed with the quality of the performance  and am anxious to purchase other cassette editions of the series."
4233,5,Wow,I enjoyed the writing. I have seen the movies first years ago and felt the need to read the books. The movie was the on screen portrayal of this book. Well done all around. I am very pleased with the writing it feels nature.
4234,5,This is a classic item. All the Harry Potter books are.,These books were instrumental in getting both of my kids to read. Rowling is a genius who created this wonderful world and populated it with all sorts of eccentric people - witches and wizards. I cannot recommend these Harry Potter books enough. And the movies. Wonderful story.
4235,5,Favorite series ever,Never a let down no matter how many times I read it. JK Rowling is a genius with her invention of the Wizarding world. I never lose interest in escaping to Hogwarts for the school year.
4236,1,Pottermore Store,Pottermore e-store does not respond sometimes and at others stops during a purchase.  Very aggravating stick to the printed versions
4237,5,"Excellent storytelling, reduced road rage","I bought this audio book used from a seller on Amazon expecting a few skips/scratches, but all discs are in excellent condition. The story makes for a relaxing and amusing ride to and from work. There's just something soothing about the way Jim Dale reads the story that I already know so well...that prevents my road rage from rearing its ugly head.I'm working on collecting the entire series."
4238,5,I have read and collected all the books. But,I enjoyed these books several years ago. Now getting to listen to them is another adventure again. Great writer and excellent narrator.
4239,5,Love,"Perfect, gave as a gift"
4240,5,Love it. Now a family favorite!,"I've read this book twice so far. Once for myself and another time for my 5 year old neice who is now obsessed with who she calls ""harrypotomus"".The book is all ages and to my great surprise it's better than the movie.The book itself is durable and the letters aren't too small.I've loved it"
4241,4,Awesome read,"First time reading the books, love them so farAwesome reading , love to read books almost as much as reading my kindle"
4242,5,Lovely Adventure!,I first read this book when my boys were little. They are grown and married but I still love to visit Harry Ron and Hermione and remember the sweetest time in my life!Keeping the adventure going...
4243,5,Excellent Condition,"I purchased a used condition because the new condition books were on back order. I was a little concerned because of some of the reviews. My book was delivered today and it‚Äôs in excellent condition! Very small damage on the cover but other than that, the book doesn‚Äôt seem like it was read at all. Very happy with my purchase."
4244,5,Share some QUALITY time with your kids....,"I read many of these reviews before I purchased this book, and found the clains hard to believe!  Well, I believe them now!  This is a wonderful, exciting read for kids and adults!  My boys are 8, 10 and 14, I encouraged  my oldest to listen in because the reviews were so good.  Much to my  surprise after we read chapter 3 he came up to me and whispered in my ear,  ""Can I read ahead""?  :-)  I told him absolutely NOT, it's a  family thing and he would have to wait like the rest of us!  :-)  He teased  as if he were asking to go and hang out with his friends...this can only be  a good thing.  I did have to take measures; as one other reader suggested,  she had to find a good hiding place for the book so there were no cheaters!  This is a terrific way to show your kids that reading is for  pleasure...not just something you HAVE to do for an assignment at school!"
4245,5,"Same brilliant story, great new look!","This is a classic children's book that will endure the test of time. Mark my words. We are immediately drawn to Harry, Hermione, and Ron and the wonderful adult influences in their lives. Hagrid, the lovable giant that is every child's dream friend, wise Prof. Dumbledore, and stern Prof. McGonagall. I run the Harry Potter Book and Movie Clubs of NYC and am thrilled to see that a new generation of children are just as thrilled with the books as my first club members. Now they have a cover that they can call their own. Kazu Kibuishi has done a fantastic job. I'm enjoying this 10th reading almost as much as I did my first. Well done!"
4246,2,Habe mir mehr davon versprochen,"Es liest sich etwas langatmig. Orientiert sich zwar am Film, bzw. der Film sich am Buch, aber es wird recht viel Umgagnssprache verwendet, und der ist nicht immer leicht zu folgen."
4247,5,Awesome,"What can you say .. Who doesn't love HARRY POTTER  great story , great writing , great movie .... On to the next"
4248,5,It‚Äôs a good series to enjoy,"Both the books and the movies are great to enjoy for reasons too numerous to mention. The books help if you happen to have the board game. Comparing the differences between the original books and the movies are great for conversations about what tidbits you especially enjoy in each, and what changes from book to movie you don‚Äôt like."
4249,5,üíñüíñüíñüíñüíñ,"I love Harry Potter by far still my favorite even as an adult, I read them over and over and they never get dull for me."
4250,5,Such a fun read,My son was 5 when this came out.  He read it aloud in Kindergarten.  I still enjoy it these 2 decades later.
4251,5,Good read,"Easy read! Looked forward to each page. My kids hounded me to read this forever, so I finally caved. I‚Äôm glad I did. Looking forward to starting the next book."
4252,5,Magical... to say the least...,"The last movie in what has been a huge part of my life is coming out in 5 days, so about a month ago, I decided that I would reread the whole series, in the hopes of falling in love with the magic all over again. It was then that I realized that I had hardcover versions of every book except the first. So of course, I hopped on Amazon, ordered this book and it arrived promptly [the next day]. I've read all except the last book at this point, and if there's one thing that I can say, it's that Harry Potter has changed my life.If you're here looking for a review of the story, just know this. Read the book. Allow yourself to be moved by the magic and use the magic to move those around you. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you may fall in love. Just read."
4253,5,Excellent start,Fantastic introduction to the world of Harry Potter. Describing a new world isn‚Äôt easy but the author has added such detail that I could actually see it. Can‚Äôt wait to start the next book.
4254,5,Amazing story,"As always, this such a great story provided by J.K. Rowling. I adore the Harry Potter series and would encourage anyone with even a slight interest in it to give it a go."
4255,5,THE BEST IN GENERATIONS,"Nothing since The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings has captured the imagination of readers. A classic as it was being written, it will be read for the ages."
4256,5,Fantastic,I‚Äôm rereading the books again after rewatching the movies. It‚Äôs been so long since I read them the first time that it feels like the first time reading them.
4257,1,Well...,"The (brand new) book cover is all messed up, misaligned and torn. I was looking to replace the books since I've lost them but this literally ruins the aesthetic feel. I think I'll have better luck at Goodwill with 2 dollar copies then these."
4258,5,Excellent,"I started reading this to my six year-old son about a month ago.  It was slow going, mainly because of his attention span.  But he's been enjoying it, nevertheless.  As I was reading it to him, I became enthralled with the  adventure and wound up reading the book by myself.  It was a great,  fast-paced read that brought out the child in me.Like everybody else, I've  been hearing the controversy.  Yes, there are some situations in the story  that might scare small children.  Pick up a book of fairy tales¬≠¬≠or, better  yet, turn on the TV.  The cartoons and kids' shows are much more violent  and graphic than anything in this book.  The Harry Potter series is  destined to be a classic for many generations."
4259,5,Fantastic as an audiobook,"I love to listen to audiobooks at work and am I big HP fan, so this was a must buy for me! Jim Dale is excellent as a narrator and J.K. Rowling's works are fantastic! Although I have read the Sorcerer's Stone countless times, I still find things that I have missed when it's read in this medium.If you're a Harry Potter and/or and audio book fan, this is a must buy! I have listened to it many times, and will be purchasing other books in the series soon."
4260,5,Brilliant!,"Brilliantly creative! Now I understand the mass appeal. I purchased this first book in the Potter series to screen it before giving a matched set (already purchased from Amazon) of the first seven novels to my six year old grandson, who is already an avid reader! Perhaps we'll hold off on that for a while. Meanwhile 'Papa' is hooked and can't wait to start Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets!"
4261,5,It's Harry Potter!,"It is the first in the Harry Potter series. It introduces you to Harry and his core friends and enemies. The first time I read this book it took me a minute to get into it. But once I did (somewhere around the 75-100 page mark) I could not put the book down. Is there really someone out there that has not read this series yet?? If so, go ahead, get the book. Doesn't matter how old you are. Chances are you will fall in love with Harry, his friends, his professors and the World of Harry Potter."
4262,5,Rereading,Now 38 and having read each of these the respective days they were released I‚Äôm surprised at just how funny this one was. I can‚Äôt wait to finish the series another go round.
4263,5,As good as advertised,Great detail and well drawn characters. Over the top creativity.  Looking forward to the rest of the series.  Cheers y‚Äôall
4264,5,A good read,Didn‚Äôt get into Harry Potter when it first came out but I actually liked the book. It kept me interested the whole time.
4265,5,harry potter is just a necessity!,"My personal favourite of the series is the half blood prince but this is equally amazing. I am a potterhead and this is my who-knows-what time reading this! for all those young readers or even more experienced readers,this should be read. Please read the book before the movie because the book is more elaborate and has great plot themes the movie is lacking."
4266,5,Harry Potter & the philosopher's stone,"I really like this book, it has wonderful adjectives good for education. Childeren would like to start harry potter from the first book. This book is a good start for grade 3-5 students."
4267,5,Excellent Deal.,So much cheaper to get this book on Amazon than at a book store. Well over 50% cheaper at the time I made this purchase. Great deal.
4268,5,All children should read this.,This is an awesome imagination exercise that will be a classic 100 years from now. If you haven't already read this then you should regardless of age.
4269,5,Young at Heart,"I started working in the daycare system when I was seventeen years old. When I was nineteen, I started working with elementary age children on a daily basis. I get them off their buses and entertain them, while they entertain me. When you're around kids this much, you learn what they like, and they scream Harry Potter quite loudly. Late in 2002, I ordered ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" off Amazon just to see what all the buzz was about.I had a broken foot at the time, so I had some free time on my hands. I literally read this book cover to cover in nine hours. I could NOT put it down. This book is so well written, that the young and young at heart will enjoy it emmencely. JK Rowling can write in the voice of a child and the voices of adults. She captures the essence of a child in the voices of her main characters, Harry, Hermione and Ron but can still write menacing characters like Professor Snape and Voldemort with the same pen... or perhaps it's a quill.I would recommend this book to all elementary school children and all adults who love good literature. Parents should read this book with their kids... it just might give them something to talk about at the dinner table."
4270,5,Great read!,Great book first of many.  Loving reading them over again since I read them years ago as a kid!Can‚Äôt wait for the next one.
4271,4,A great series of books to put in braille.,"I liked the book, keeping in mind that the version I have is the braille version, so my rating is primarily concerning the format of the book, and not its plot. This is an excellent book to put into braille format and I hope that the sequels are also done. I can see but I am a braille reader and transcriptionist, and this book is nicely packaged and well-bound. I did note several typographical errors in the book, but not more than usually found in an ink-printed book. Five stars would have been for zero errors, as otherwise what's not to like about Harry Potter?"
4272,5,Sorcerers Stone,"Brilliant. Brilliant.  Brilliant .  And in case anyone is not paying attention, Brilliant.  Which is Brilliant in and of itself."
4273,5,The magic begins‚Ä¶.,The book that‚Äôs starts off to a magical journey in the wizard world with the boy who has lived and cherish the bad with pure bravery and wit.
4274,5,Came in perfect condition and really fast!!,"These came in EXCELLENT condition!! Hardback, no scratches, no dents or bends, they were perfect! I‚Äôm excited to read them over again!!"
4275,5,Great narration on a timeless story,Great story plus an excellent narrator.  I call Jim Dale's performance masterful.  He can do all those characters and bring them alive.  Nothing fake.J  k Rowling's story is timeless.  Her use of vocabulary really expands the narrative.This is the 3rd set I brought as a gift to people.
4276,5,Whether it is your first read or the hundredth time each re-read is just as magical.,Setting up the Wizarding world while woving the first adventure is pure magic. Getting to know the trio on the start of their journey remains as magical the hundredth time as the first.
4277,5,The illustrations and ‚Äúpop out‚Äù art are amazing,I got the book for my seven year old niece who has started reading chapter books. I was nervous that it would be too advance for her and she would become bored. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that there were amazing illustrations on every page. I think this has helped ease my niece into reading such a large book. She love it!
4278,5,I finally did it!,"I‚Äôve wanted to read this book for years, but I was afraid it would be too juvenile or uninteresting to me‚Ä¶I WAS WRONG! I wish I hadn‚Äôt waited - what a fun and thrilling story. The rest of the series is in my future."
4279,4,overall amazing book.,Little disappointed. I don't like it when the seller doesn't state weather it has the dust jacket or not and its a long and hard guessing game to try and find one that does. Book had minor stains and dents on the cover but I expected that seeing as I was buying used. I bought all the hard cover books off of amazon of the Harry Potter series. Not a single one of the sellers stated that it was missing the dust jacket and 6 out of the 7 books came with them. Buyer beware if you want one with the dust jacket contact the seller and ask first.
4280,5,Love the books!,"I decided to start buying the Kindle version of these books to participate in the book club. I love the Harry Potter series. The storytelling is vivid and involving, immersing myself as a first year arriving at Hogwarts for the first time. For the price and convenience of having these stories around wherever I go, this is a great investment."
4281,5,Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone,"Love it.  I don't have a chance to read much about the children books.  However, I found this book is highly imaginative.  Eventhough, some parts are violence concerning this is a book for 9-12 years old kids.  But look  to the bright side, this book contained every children dream.  Imagine  this! the lonely boy who never seen his parent, never know who he is, live  with the relative who hate him for the reason that he never know for 10  suffering years.  Then one day, he found out that he is a wizard and a  famous one too.  Lot of fantasy, I must said.  But who would not love  fantasy story.  If you are an adult, please...please read it with a child  heart because this book is for everyone who still young at heart."
4282,5,Harry's the Hero,"Love, love, love the Harry Potter series.  Have read all of them numerous times, as well as watched the movies.  Books are wa-a-ay better than the movies.  Recommend them highly for young or old readers."
4283,5,Timeless,This is maybe my 4th time reading?  Still as good as the first time.  Always forget it's supposed to be a children's book
4284,5,Better than the first time.,"The first time I heard this story was when I was so young my parents had to read it to me. Now, having a renewed interest in the series, I have to say that The Sorcerer's Stone is still in my top ten  non fiction books allong with the other books in the series. This novel is exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I highly reccomend it to anyone who enjoys a good story."
4285,5,ANDO 2DX RECOMMENDS,"Easy to read on Kindle app for iOS.Twenty years later, I finally was able to read the first installment of the series.Looking forward to reading the rest of the titles."
4286,5,Love Harry Potter,Borrowed the first book when I was younger bought the rest so needed to complete the collection so my son could read them.
4287,5,A must for tour collection,A must need for all Harry Potter fans. Beautiful and elegant..... just love the book and is perfect
4288,5,Harry Potter My Second Favorite Story!!!!!!,I love the Harry Potter books and I love to listen to them while building scenes from the books I right in Minecraft. The discs are great! Not scratched at all. They play great!
4289,5,Love it!,"I've loved this series for a long, long time. I still have my original hardcovers,  just had to buy it once again for my kindle as well."
4290,5,First time reading thi¬°,I have always held.off reading this series but it's on my top 100 book club list to read so I didn't have a choice and so very glad I read this book! Can't wait to read the rest!
4291,5,Classic!,"Bought this for the grandkid for her birthday.  Since I read it and loved it, she will as well.  While I didn't get into the whole Harry Potter thing until like the third book and was skeptical about them, I found out I adored them!  While made for younger ones, they grabbed me and held tight.  They are excellent!  I strongly recommend them for anyone who likes this genre"
4292,5,A story to lose oneself in.,"Each time I read Harry Potter, I feel I am visiting an old friend. A great story is like a trap door that opens beneath my feet. I can plunge headfirst into a world and lose myself in the wonder."
4293,5,Wow.,You know the saying ‚Äúbooks are always better than the Meir movie counterparts.‚Äù In this case it could not be more true!!! I have watched the movies for years and finally decided to read the books. Now I know why they were made into movies. Phenomenal!!!
4294,4,Enjoyable,Very well written.  I can now see why my grandson is so fond of reading about Harry Potter as is his grandmother.
4295,5,Great book,I read the entire series many moons ago I bought this for my niece who is 7 and starts third grade next semester
4296,5,Truly Magical,"I‚Äôve read this book a few of dozen times over the years. I‚Äôve tried, each time, to figure out how to put into words my feelings on it. I fail every time. But here I am, trying once again. I‚Äôm going to try and speak of just this book in this review ‚Äì so (beyond these few statements) I won‚Äôt touch on how incredibly built the series is. Each book is builds on the ones before it, widening and strengthening the world. There are foreshadowings and moments peppered throughout the series that sometimes don‚Äôt come into play for many books to come. As Harry grows and becomes more mature, so too do these books. It‚Äôs something that‚Äôs almost impossible to realize here, in the first one, and that I still appreciate each and every time I pick up this series.When I first picked up Harry Potter and the Sorcerer‚Äôs Stone I had no idea the impact it would have on my life. It was just a story, about a boy that finds out he‚Äôs a wizard and has to fight the forces of evil. That‚Äôs what I thought when I started it that first time.Very quickly I was drawn into the world of magic that J.K. Rowling penned, surrounded by witches and wizards, magic, and muggles. When I try to examine my feelings for this (and all future books), I run into the problem of not being able to quantify what makes it so special.The story is a classic; boy finds out he‚Äôs special, learns about world, fights evil, wins. The world is intricate and fun, with a lot of cleverness ‚Äì plays on words, simple ciphers, and logic puzzles made me smile ‚Äì while still being straightforward. The characters, though varied and three-dimensional, are fairly standard.And yet, this all combines into this wonderful, fantastical world that pulls me in and makes me wonder what‚Äôs hiding behind that brick wall over there, or what I might be missing out of the corner of my eye.I remember, distinctly, the feeling of sorrow that I had upon finishing this first book and realizing I was already too old to get a letter to Hogwarts. The world is so enchanting that I can‚Äôt help but want to be a part of it. It‚Äôs all about the feeling that it evokes in me. It makes me feel like there‚Äôs magic in the world, and it‚Äôs not necessarily the turn-a-mouse-into-a-snuff-box type of magic, or the type where the chess pieces actually fight each other (though, how awesome would that be?). It‚Äôs the type where friendship is stronger than anything that gets thrown at it. Where people, kids, can fight against injustice and wrong ‚Äì and win. It lets you know that life isn‚Äôt always fair, and that you might have to battle against things that are scary and horrible, but the happiness at the end is always worth it.And I suppose that‚Äôs what keeps me coming back, time and time again, to re-read, revisit, and relive this story. It makes me feel a part of something amazing.And that is definitely magical."
4297,5,Love these books.,"One of my favorite things about the Harry Potter books is how JK Rowling's writing builds over the course of the series. Her narrative voice starts strong in The Sorcerer's Stone, and just keeps getting better. I've read the whole series multiple times over, and it's something I'll always return to. It's just so cool to watch her writing grow right alongside her characters."
4298,5,Rereading for the first time in 20 years.,"Such a great story, and well told. It is even more fun rereading it than I had imagined.  Harry Potter is one of those stories that will forever be a classic."
4299,5,Book is always better than the movie,Have been a Harry Potter fan for many years never took the time to read the books until now and would recommend to everyone!! The book is always better than the movie for sure.
4300,5,So good,It‚Äôs the first time I read Harry Potter and it is as addictive as they say. Can‚Äôt wait to read the next book!
4301,5,Excellent Beginning to the Series.,"I've read a couple of the Harry Potters series and enjoyed them. This was obviously the first in the series, and was excellent. It kept my interest throughout. Rowling has a wonderful imagination and I would love to know where her characters come from, in her world.  I am not a child or teenager. I'm an 81 year old great grandmother and I enjoy these books as much as my 8 year old super smart great grandson."
4302,4,A great book Harry Potter is a great wizard,"I chose this rating because the story was great and very intresting. It may a lot of things I liked for example:Magic, competition,adventure, and finally friendship. The only thing I didn't like was the beginning of wasn't very exciting until Harry got his second letter from Hogwarts (The first one he got was when he was a baby) Try to make all of it exciting.üëç‚ö°üî•üåü"
4303,5,Fantastic!,"I've seen the movie at least a half dozen times, and love it. I have been reluctant to read the book simply because I thought I knew everything with the story.I was wrong.There is so much additional detail that simply cannot fit into the movie.  Fantastic read, I highly recommend. Oh, and just to shatter any stereotype that may be hanging there, I am a 43 year old guy.  This is a story that can be enjoyed by anyone who lives great story telling."
4304,5,A masterpiece for all ages,"After hearing so many recommendations on a Georgette Heyer listserv I belong to, I tried out HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE. I was quickly drawn into Harry's world, and I just had to read the others in the  series.J. K. Rowling has created a very detailed world that people of  all ages will find enchanting. Harry quickly earns our sympathy when we  meet his horrible family, the Dursleys. We share Harry's joy when he  escapes their clutches to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and  Wizardry, where he is appreciated for the first time he can remember.  Hurrah for Harry Potter and J. K. Rowling!"
4305,5,"It has the genres that anyone would love it fine in a book! Fantasy, action and adventure, even a bit of humor in it üòÑ","I choose this rating because the book had a lot of adventure, fantasy and action in it!And those are the type of genres that I love to see whenever I'm reading/watching a series, movies and books! Especially if it has humor in it, even if it's a little :>I would recommend this to my friend who I consider as my brother uwu for he has not read or watched Harry Potter, and as a gamer, he'll definitely like the action this book has :>"
4306,5,Still great,"Harry Potted, still easy and fun to read, even after all these years, after all the movies and after all the fuss has died down."
4307,5,JK Rowling's masterpiece that started it all,"Back when I was relatively young (mid 20s), I read a book by Stephen King called ""On Writing."" At the back of that non-fiction book, he had a list of a lot of his recommended books, and among others it listed the 1st 3 Harry Potter books. I was kind of surprised because even though I knew they were wildly popular at that time, I also knew that they were just children's books. I still hadn't made up my mind to read them yet, until I saw the trailer to the first movie. I decided to take a chance and buy and read the first book just to see if all the hype was real. I was hooked by the end of the first chapter, and read the whole book in just 1 day. The next day i went back to the store to buy books 2 and 3, the only ones on paperback at that time, and finished those 2 in another 3 days. I tried really hard to wait for paperback on book 4, but I just couldn't do it, and I bought the 4th in hardcover and it took 2 or 3 days (it's pretty long). Needless to say, I think this was the best book series I have ever read, and book 1 is a great beginning to an epic tale. Highly recommended."
4308,5,The hype is legitimate!,"I originally ordered the set of books for my children after hearing the rave reviews since ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" started flying off the shelves.  Unfortunately the books continued to be put to the wayside due to homework and busy schedules.  I am an avid reader of medical mystery and horror thrillers, so reluctantly I picked up this book convinced that it would never live up to the hype as portrayed by the media.  Boy was I wrong.  This was truly a remarkable story that lives up to the highest ranking reviews.  I am now reading the third volume and the stories keep getting better with each page.  J.K. Rowling is brilliant!"
4309,5,Best ever,"I've been reading all my life and now that I'm in my 50s, I'm still reading.I've read this series 3 or 4 times now and I'm reading it again and it's still the best series of books I've ever read. The movies are great but you just can't beat the book!"
4310,1,1st Page of every chapter empty.,Every chapter began on the second or third page. Terrible copy.
4311,5,A perennial favorite,I have enjoyed reading the Harry Potter series every few years since they were written. I read them to my children as bedtime stories as they grew up. They have brought hours of imaginary happiness to our family.
4312,5,Always my fav,This book is the beginning of a whole new world. So excited to now share it with my children. Such a good read.
4313,5,Best Book I have Ever Read!!!!,"(This was written by my 7 year old daughter): The Sorcerer`s Stone is the best book I have ever read!!! It in involves dying . There are 3 best friends Harry, Ron, and Hermiane . They are at a school called Hogwarts for wizards and witches. There are four houses Griffandor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slitherin. They are houses for students to live in at school. They go on adventures that involve magic and mysteries. I recommend this book for ages 7 and up.Don`t watch the movie before you read the book."
4314,5,An intro to one of the best series in 20 years,Dude come on its Harry Potter I'm not even a big reader but I blew through these books in 3 months simply magical and I'm a grown azz man
4315,5,Favorite in the series,Author did a wonderful job creating the characters and plot.
4316,5,Loved it!,"First book was awesome to read, read it in one say and looking forward to the rest of the series!"
4317,5,A great read,"Glade I finally was able read this wonderful book. In my youth I struggled with reading, but now being an adult I was able to enjoy without the struggle."
4318,5,Hufflepuff for life!,"If you haven't heard of Harry Potter-you've been under a rock-read these books! A defining series of my generation-and obviously I love it! This is just the beginning of Harry's story, so it is very light hearted writing (although as an adult you can see more mature content you didn't see as a kid i.e. prejudice, child abuse, etc.), but as the story continues in the following books, the writing gets heavier. I have re-read the story multiple times in my youth and adult life, and I am always happy that I did. I purchased the kindle version so I could carry the series with me anywhere I go! Fun and easy read for adults, great underlying ideas for children (friendship, family, love, respect...) all wrapped up in a fun story about a boy wizard! Again, seriously, read this series if you haven't!"
4319,5,Excellent,This book is in excellent condition. I couldn‚Äôt be happier! Got here faster then expected!
4320,3,Pages Missing,"At first I thought the pacing of the book was worse than I remember it. For example Harry recovers from [REDACTED]'s jinx and then immediately catches the Snitch? Then I noticed pages are missing, in several places"
4321,4,"excellent writing, great plot, frustrating characters","Reader thoughts:These books are so addicting! I do enjoy them a lot, but I have some issues with them, too.JKR puts too much witchcraft and ghosts into her books, and I can't stand the characters. They lie and cheat and steal, even when it isn't necessary. They're very disobedient and rarely get punished for it. They're also immature under their age some of the time. The children treat the adults like stupid overseers, and most of the adults act that way.Plus, these fit into the books-that-make-me-moody-when-I'm-reading-them category. I get upset more easily and feel stressed when I'm reading certain books, especially ones that have disobedient characters (or mean characters, or ones that have bad morals). Those books tend to get DNFed.However, you can clearly see that I like these (read multiple times and 4/5 stars). Why do I like them?Moving castle! My favorite part of the whole series is the Hogwarts school. I like the sorting, the classes, the tests, the magical creatures, and the strong personalities of not only students but teachers also.Hermione! She is, by far, my favorite character. She was a lot like I was, actually. I have no doubt that she has influenced countless young girls to like learning. She puts up with rather knuckleheaded friends, but I love that she loves school.The Dursleys. It's not that I like them, but they do make these books more interesting. I always feel sorry for Harry after reading anything about the Dursleys.The plot is good, too. Sure, there are lots of stories that have a prophecy and a chosen one, but it's a fun plot all the same. There's so much pressure on Harry, and lots of expectations. Everyone he meets in the wizarding world either hates him or loves him, but they all know him. It's cool.It's basically a rags-to-riches tale. I love the idea of an orphan boy who suddenly finds out he has magic and there's this great magical community. I love the idea of a dark lord trying to take over and targeting this young boy in particular. I love that a mother's love is given so much power.Writer thoughts:I think JKR is an amazing writer. The plotting and descriptions and story and ideas are all superb. I love all the brilliant foreshadowing.She is also really good at stretching a plot over the course of a year and not making it feel slow. JKR can pass time without the reader realizing it. Suddenly it's autumn. Suddenly is Christmas. And then spring tests. Authors can learn a lot from studying her books."
4322,5,A Classic in the Making,Already read this book. It's so immersive and I just wanted to contribute once again you great literature. May read it over again.
4323,5,A book that turns kids unto reading!,"I have purchased copies of this book for four grandchildren, boys and girls.  They all love it and have read it several times.  They could hardly wait for the other two books to be published.  In this day and age of  computers, tv, videos, etc., it is wonderful to see and hear of the  excitement that this book creates.  There is nothing like your own  imagination that is developed by reading.  I loved the book as well.  We  have been to the authors book signing and I would say she is the premier  author of this century as she has done what no one else could do....bring  kids back to the joy of reading!!"
4324,5,Already s classic,This first book sets up the whole series perfectly.  The author said in interviews that there would be a book for each year and the books would grow in intensity as the age of the target audience grew.  So many things were introduced that it really did take The Who.e series to explain the back story off all. the main characters .aquick and exciting read meant for an audience. the same age as the protagonist.  Obviously she got it right!
4325,5,Great replacement to my failing Casette tapes.,"My old cassette version was completely unplayable so I had to buy newer copies. This item came factory shrink-wrapped and the box was in perfect shape. I look forward to playing these until they too are unplayable. Jim Dale hadn't quite got it down in the first book, some of the pronunciations were off and his voices got so much better as he continued the series. But it's a wonderful flashback to when it first came out. Great re-listen."
4326,5,Harry Potter book one,Could not put it down.  Wonderful story and so well written. Looking forward to book two. Certainly will read all of them.
4327,5,Amazing,These books captured my attention as a child and they are doing the same some 20 years later! I lesrnnnew things with every read.
4328,5,This book is a classic comfort read-in my opinion,"I know this is a children‚Äôs book. However, J.K. Rowling writes with such fluidity that I just lose myself in this book. Love it!"
4329,5,Greatest book I've ever read,I would recomend this book to others I loved the story of friendship and adventures between all the characters. Amazing.
4330,5,A magic dream,"I've read it a million times, and each time it gets better. Just can't seem to put it down. I get all the feelings in every page. Best series ever!!!"
4331,5,First-time Harry Potter Reader at 31 years old,Sorcerer's Stone came on the scene when I was 11. I was not permitted to read the books at that age. But  I've heard all the wonderful reviews and listened to all the love people had for Harry. My best friend introduced me to Harry Potter's‚Äã world by watching the movies. She would pause the movie and tell me how scenes really went in the book. So I decided that once we made it through the movies I would start reading the first book. Great decision if you ask me. Great story telling. It felt like anyone of any age could read it and not be overwhelmed or bored!!! I highly recommend to anyone that hasn't jumped this vivid world created by J.K. Rowling to get reading!!!
4332,5,Great story,"If your a fan of Harry Potter in general, this is your story to get yourself lost in. This my first time reading Harry Potter."
4333,5,Who doesn't like Harry Potter?,"It's hard to believe there is anyone out there who is not familiar with Harry Potter and how outstanding a writer is J.K. Rowling.  Enough said.  Read these books if you haven't.  I just read the first one and could not put it down.  Every bit as good as the movie, with a little more detail."
4334,5,"Harry Potter, can't go wrong for all ages!","Harry Potter, can't go wrong. My 6, 7, and 8 year old love the whole series. You must read the books before watching the movies."
4335,5,Couldn't put it down,I decided to read a few pages to see if it was something I would like since I got it free/on loan to read as a Prime member.  Once I started I couldn't put it down.  Fortunately it was one of my days off and I was able to finish it later that day.  I'm now in the process of reading the entire series.
4336,4,It is fantasy for fantasy sake.,"The Harry Potter series is quite ""wonderful,"" but for something really special you must have the illlustrated version.  Even those children who are tired of ""chapter"" books will love the illustrations."
4337,5,Harry Potter,"My granddaughter is dyslexic and cannot find any books of interest at her reading level for her age.  So, we co-read all of her books that she is to be reading for school.  This is the one we chose this month.  I had a copy that I bought at a garage sale for her to read, and I bought myself a copy for my Kindle!  Really helps my baby find something that she's interested in reading!!!"
4338,5,Great Read,I am a teacher and I purchased this book for my Autistic nephew who initially did not like to read. He is an avid reader now and he loves the Harry Potter books. I'm so glad I got it in hardback.
4339,5,An exciting read!,"I regret that it took so long for me to begin reading these books, but I'm glad to finally understand what all the fuss was about. There are valuable life lessons to be learned between the lines of this story. They're far more impactful when presented in this manner, no matter how young or old you happen to be."
4340,1,No casing for book,No casing
4341,5,Great start to an even better series,"It feels so long ago that I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for the first time. I can't remember exactly how I felt upon completion, but I must have loved it because I devoured the rest of the books--there were only three of them back then--in a matter of days.What I can remember is how agonizingly long the wait for the other books was, how I reread the first book when I was scared of being the new kid in school, and how I became friends with other fans of the series. I remember feeling stronger after reading about Harry's strength, and, most importantly, I remember how much I grew to love reading.This all probably sounds terribly sappy, but to the people who call this book unimaginative, contrived, and even claim Harry and his friends are bad role models, I would just like to say that kids don't see any of that. This kid saw the importance of friendship and courage, even in the face of evil, and a place to escape to when she need to be reminded of these things. Adults need to remember that this is a children's book, and no one should read it expecting an existential masterpiece. The books grow as Harry grows, and as JK Rowling grows as an author.Is this book perfect? No, but for a kid reading it for the first time, it's close enough."
4342,5,Loving this book!!!!!!!!,I think that the book was good because it was a great Idea that they made Harry Potter  books because they are very exciting and funny and also it made me think of real life and what's happening in the world  and to me it was excellent for me so yeah.
4343,5,Still an awesome read,"Better than the movies! The images the mind can develop are Better than what film can record. And more of the story can be told with words,"
4344,5,Perfect,My original hard copy was ruined so I needed a new one. This is perfect.
4345,5,Favorite series,This was my favorite series as a child and still my favorite series as an adult.  Brings you into a whole world of imagination.
4346,2,Better when you are a kid.,"The book needs work. The rewrites have take out viral parts of the story, leaving more contradictions.  Clearly there is a reason she doesn't write anything outside of the Harry Potter universe."
4347,5,My second time.,Anyone who has been alive in the past twenty should have an idea of the wonder and magic of the Harry Potter series of books. They are wonderful and entertaining and it is my pleasure to enter the world of Harry Potter again. I will be sad when I'm done.
4348,5,much better than the movie!,"I loved the movies, but the book is ALWAYS better. I should have read the books first. So much detail and humor and suspense! Loved every minute!"
4349,5,Love HP,"Made the purchase for a 9 year old, and he is officially hooked on HP. I like the ""newer"" design cover. He now wants the entire series :)"
4350,5,hardback book,"good price,popular series.hard back"
4351,3,No book cover,Showed up without a book cover. Otherwise it's in great shape and perfect. Just disappointed that it didn't have the book cover
4352,1,The paperback not illustrated,"I love the Harry Potter series, & thought the paperback I ordered was the illustrated copy. Nope. Returning. ‚òπ"
4353,5,Son loved it,The book was delivered promptly and in great condition. My son loved reading this book which was great because he is not a big reader.
4354,5,My first love,This book is one of my very first memories of reading. Loved it as a child and loved it even more as an adult.
4355,5,Great book,"One of my best definitely. 5star , I recommend it for all readers from 10-infinity. Still don't let 9 under read this or at least not chapter 15  ""The forbidden forest"" at night"
4356,5,The best,My absolute favorite series. I‚Äôve read it multiple times and finally my son is old enough to be interested in me reading it to him. And he LOVES it! On to book 2!
4357,5,Fantastical lol,Well I have read this series numerous times and it still hasn't gotten old. I have the actual books but I also purchased them to be on my kindle as well. This is a fun and exciting story of kids attending a wizard school and all the adventures they have together. Love it! ‚ù§Ô∏è
4358,5,Wonderful read,Felt like I was a wizard myself. üòÇ somehow I feel like a kid reading these books (I‚Äôll probably read them all over again when I‚Äôm finished haha) well done
4359,5,Harry is WONDERFUL on tape!,"My husband and I are in our forties, and we LOVED listening to the first Harry Potter on audiotape, read by Jim Dale (a British actor). He did an incredible job, keeping all the characters quite individual and  recognizable. We look forward to hearing all the books. I want to own the  books in the print version, but I've heard so much about differences in the  British and American versions that I don't know if it changes the content.  I might want the originals - but I don't know enough to make a decision."
4360,5,Perfect for gifts,I had to gift a copy to one of the five people left on the planet that hasn't read them. Harry Potter is my favorite series and I'm excited to share them with someone new!
4361,5,Love new cover!,Great addition to my HP collection!
4362,5,Great condition!,"I got this used and it came in almost perfect condition! A couple small marks very few pages, easily ignored. Dust cover looks new and so does the edges and bindings!"
4363,5,Harry Potter and the Scorcerer's Stone,It's best first book in any series. I love rereading it every once in a while it helps me remember things.
4364,5,Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone,"Of course if you have come here your like me, a HUGE Harry Potter fan! I'm working on getting all the stories on audio, and this is the first. Harry Potter no matter how many times I listen to it, every single time without fail I fall in love with these books all over again. J.K Rowling is phenomenal,  and has created a magic that will live on for an eternity!"
4365,5,A great read!,I am a retired educator who loves to read. I have read this entire series multiple times! J.K. Rowling is a gifted writer that can truly spin a fantastic tale!
4366,5,A book of Mom's Teachings,"Being brave to face our problems, remembering that a mother's love will take care of us for a lifetime and remembering that our life is our responsibility are some of the main teachings that a mom's book gives us."
4367,5,As described!,The book arrived like new and was as described!
4368,5,Who knew reading about wizards cound be so entertaining?,I am reading the books along with my 7 year old granddaughter who does not live nearby. We discuss the chapters via Facetime on our IPhones.  She remembers all the names.  I need to take notes as I read so I can keep up with her.  It is a great experience.
4369,5,Absolutely love it!,I don't read much but I'm changing that. I loved the movies growing up and decided I HAD to read the books. This book is amazing. Loved finding all the scenes that weren't in the movies or altered.
4370,5,Starter CD for my grandson.,Gift for my grandson. He loves it!
4371,5,This was the perfect solution. All three of us were completely engaged ...,I purchased this audio book for a road trip I was taking with my 8 year old son and 3 year old daughter.  They both get motion sick so watching movies was not an option for holding their attention.  This was the perfect solution.  All three of us were completely engaged throughout the 8 hours of audio book.  Now I need to go back and read all 8 books again!
4372,4,Granddaughter lives this book,Easy reading
4373,5,"enchanting for adult readers, too","I will forgo the usual plot outline in deference to the wealth of information from other reviewers.  Yes the book is popular with younger readers - but this is not just a kid's book.  As an adult reader, I was surprised and pleased to be as drawn into the J.K. Rowling's world.  What an imagination!  And what a marverlous cast of characters.  Little wonder so many are so taken with the story and that they are so wildly popular.  A wonderful mental vacation - I highly recommend it.  Enjoy!"
4374,5,Ckfj,Idiffjfjfi I I I. Isieie idisisi Didi I I I I I I jisididi u usisu idisu me d good stuff
4375,5,Just fun.,"I loved these books when they came out. They gave us so much pleasure as we read them aloud to or children. Now, rereading them by myself, I find myself smiling at the funny little details that my children loved. And in these books the goodness of the humanity always wins. I wish that were true in the muggle world."
4376,5,Imaginative and brilliant,"Read this with my 11 year old grandson.  We both loved the characters, the intrigue, the surprises, and the action.  This is one not to be missed -- and just the beginning of the Harry Potter's adventures."
4377,5,One of my favorite books,If you are looking for an exciting read full of magic and friendship this is the book for you. You will not be disappointed.
4378,2,Age,"My granddaughter's teacher said she was ready for Harry Potter books,I purchased only the 1st series, however, she has only half finished it.She was not to fond of it. Every child is different and you must allowthem to choose their own choice of books."
4379,5,LOVE IT,This was the only one of the series that I didn't have in hardback so I'm happy to finally finish the collection.
4380,5,Good storytelling it is very imaginative.,Book was good liked everything about it. I read the book when I was in high school and I wanted to see if it would be a different idea it turned out that the older one gets the better image one can see.
4381,5,Perfect Quality,I have my complete set of HP books from their original release date. My Sorcerer's Stone copy was lost over the years so I bought this to replace it and complete my set. It looks identical to the original hardcovers (in US). So thankful my set is complete again!
4382,5,Poor science nerd me didn't know what I was missing as a kid,"Not gonna lie, it is 2018 and I'n just now reading this. I was too into non-fiction as a child to bother with a book about magical schools and whatnot. So far, I'm loving it! The movies were good, but this is way better. elementary school aged me was missing out!"
4383,5,My 7 yr old is officially a HP fan!,This was my daughters first taste of reading a regular chapter book and im excited that she loved every second of it! Thank you jk for introducing this magical world to our kids!
4384,5,Awesome Bedtime Series,My daughter loved this book! I am buying them for her to read at bedtime and she fell in love.
4385,5,Wonderful for a Harry Potter fan!,"The bessssst! I love listening to these. Love Jom Dale reading them, does the voices of the characters in a cool way. Bought them new, great quality for the price"
4386,5,"nice, but the edges were dented a bit","i wanted to give this to a friend, so i wanted it to be perfect and i expected it to, but the top and bottom edges of the book were dented :( wtv tho"
4387,5,Awesome book,I needed this book to complete my series. My daughter gave it to me for Christmas.
4388,5,First time read,It was hard to read the first few chapters but once I got to chapter 5 it was smooth. I have seen the movies countless times but never read the books. I'm glad I decided to üôÇ
4389,5,Yay pog,This was an amazing book I loved it and it was not difficult to read. It was also a fairly quick book to read
4390,5,Love it,Came in great shape! I got the hardcover. Came in new and perfect!
4391,5,Great,Great book! Great read for readers of all ages. She starts this world that is absolutely amazing and will hope you in and you gonna wanna read the rest
4392,5,Love Harry potter,I love all the Harry potter books always have. So much better than the movies more in depth fantastic series for all ages!
4393,2,Sliced Book Sleeve,"Love the book, but it looks like when the book sleeve was sliced with a razor. This hurts my heart as I am a lifelong HP fan and this was the last hardback I needed to complete my collection."
4394,5,Harry Potter,I have watched all the movies and loved them. I have had people tell me to  read the booms but this the first one I have read.There is enough of a difference in the books to keep you reading it. I will have to get another one to read.
4395,5,Loved the book.,I have the original paperback and bookmark that I bought from scholastic when I was in elementary school. Memories.
4396,5,Spectacular Book!!!!,"Love the book, wanted to reread it so I purchased it on Amazon, and just great. Good pickup for anyone to either reread or read for the first time."
4397,5,Couldn't recommend more.,"I paid 15.52 to Amazon.com LLC for this product.I bought this for the first time since I was a kiddo. I am reading it to my daughters 8 and 10, both a few years farther along in maturity. They are just as mesmerized with the Harry Potter world as I was :).Couldn't recommend more."
4398,5,You'll lose sleep over how good this is!!,"If you have even thought about getting this book.....you should!!! You'll only have to decide hard or soft-cover.For anyone who likes or is interested in even the slightest bit of supernatural fiction, YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK. The author is brilliantly creative and the story-line is just perfect.I could hardly keep my hands off this book; I read this in two sittings which probably would have been just one if I haden't started late the first night."
4399,5,Almost like a guided dream,"I just completed reading this lovely book. I had no preconceptions before I began reading as I never read any of the books before, haven't watched the movies, and, hopefully, pending a trip to Harry Potter world in Universal Studios.I give this book a rating of 5 for it's creativity and it's fairly enjoyable style of writing. As an Orthopedic surgeon (R1) there is very little creativity in my daily life. Reading something magical and fun like this reminded me of how beautiful it is of an experience to dream."
4400,5,Great gift and very happy for larger print!,Person is enjoying the book and the large print really helps
4401,5,One of the best novels read in a long time,"For a first novel, I have to say that J K Rowling really knows how to glue her readers to her story. The characters are believable, the story is just excellent, especially the miror of erised chapter which is probably one of the best in the whole series.Not only is it a great book, but we get to see how Jo Rowling started plotting her whole series and we get to see all the little clues and details that eventually not only influence the future books, but also important elements coming back in the last chapters of the series.A great beginning for a great author."
4402,5,Magical,Very good book great magic . the imagination was great. It kept my interest can't wait for the next book
4403,5,good,great series for grand daughter. she loves them a lot
4404,5,Love,Purchased just to have a brand new copy and I love it.
4405,5,Best series yet,"This is the 16th or 17th time I have read the series. I originally bought the books, but they began to call apart from being read so often.  I now read everything from Kindle Unlimited. I have begun to read the series to my 7 year old grandchild. She is enjoying them as well."
4406,5,Best Book Ever.,The title says it
4407,5,Love this series,Rereading it for the first time since I was a kid (back when you had to wait for JK Rowling to write the next new book üòÇ) and it‚Äôs just as wonderful as I remember.
4408,5,Awesome,This story is amazing and I‚Äôm looking so forward to reading the rest of this series! Had my attention from the start üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
4409,5,First time reading the book.,I have and own every Harry Potter movie! They will always be my favorite thing. But I have been wanting to read the series for a awhile now. And I'm so happy I did. I do love the book over the movie. Reading about parts the movie kept out was such a treat! I gave it five stars because it deserves more! I would recommend this book to any child or adult!
4410,5,It,"Is good because yeSVery he c,vv Beth CNNfnbfcbxv fetch. Dr vs. Gadget dye. DVD tech. C strive they just truth sit"
4411,5,Harry Potter is Awesome!,My brother and I had a little battle with the spells of harry pottet. It went like this:Me:StupefyHim:ProtegoMe:CollaportusHim:ImpedementaMe:ReductoHim:Engorgio(on himself)Me: AVADA KEDAVRA!!And so I won. Thank you J.K Rowling!
4412,1,Faulty product.,Discs would not play in any player.  Had to throw away.
4413,5,It was really good and nice,This is my daughter's review after reading it on my Kindle - It was all I dreamed of. It took me less time than reading it on soft or hard back book.
4414,5,The First of the Series,"It is the first of the series wrote at a time when many didn't know how things would turn out. Would Harry ever actually fight Voldemort was my first thought once closing my hard print version. Great book to re read, and notice the settings and details you have forgotten years past."
4415,5,Love üíòthis series of books,Read these books when they first came out.... Watched all the movies.... Can't get enough of them... Wish they would have written more.
4416,5,Awesome book!,This was a very cool book. It is about Harry Potter and his friends Ron and Hermione. They learn magic and have adventures at a school for Wizards. You should read it because they are a lot of interesting characters. (Review by Alex T. Age 9)
4417,5,"Harry Potter CDs, better than the movies","If you've got an imagination, these CDs are better than the movies.  You can listen to them to and from work.  Makes commuting a lot less stressful and a lot more interesting.  The Harry Potter series itself is absolutely awesome.  Struggling through good and evil, Harry Potter enchants the imagination and leaves you wondering at the mystery.  When the book is done, you'll be looking forward to the next.  I personally look forward to the opportunities I have to sit down and listen.  All of the story CDs are read by the same narrator and he does voices for the different charectors.  The CDs are done very well.  Definitely worth the extra money to get them in this format.  Even if I'd read all the books, I'd say this format is a worth while purchase."
4418,5,GREAT BOOK WITH SUCH A HIGH DETAIL FROM THE MOVIE.,THE BOOK WAS SOOOO AWESOME! CHARACTERS HAVE ALMOST THE SAME ROLES AS THE MOVIE
4419,5,Of course it great,"Love the characters, had a great build up introducing the characters, and had a great finish.  Four more words as required."
4420,5,3rd read through,A brilliant read even after the first two. I missed reading this book and look forward to reading the rest.
4421,5,Nice,Good book
4422,5,Greatest first book!,I love the story and it‚Äôs a great book!
4423,5,Loved it!!,"I know it a little backwards because I watched all the movies before I read the books.  It was nice to read the first book, it filled in the gaps in the movie. I look forward to reading the other books."
4424,5,Perfect,It‚Äôs in perfect condition! I love it. Thank you so much
4425,5,5th time reading,Easily 4th or 5th time I‚Äôve read this still great. Can‚Äôt wait to reread the others ones to drill as good as the first time
4426,5,Item was in like new condition.,Was a gift for my grand daughters birthday. Item was in new condition.
4427,5,Fun and easy read,Harry Potter series is a fun and easy read for beginner fantasy readers!Not just for kids! Highly recommend this book!
4428,5,For Harry Potter fans its a cant miss,Loved it.
4429,5,Don't miss out on this well read series.,Amazingly well read. Characters come to life.
4430,5,Rowling has a terrific sense of humor,"This series is rather in the line of the C.S. Lewis Narnia books;  both place young children from the ordinary world into a magical one and transport us to a place where reality is slightly bent.Rowling's knack for detail is remarkable, from Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans to the ins and outs of Quidditch.  A wonderful story.  I only wish these books had been around when I was a kid.  They're fabulous reading for one and all."
4431,5,Just what I ordered!,"Needed another copy as a gift, and the receipient loves it."
4432,5,Very good book,"I am reading this series again since 2000. Even after 21 years, it is still a great book and story."
4433,5,Timeless Classic,This is probably the fifth or sixth time I've reread Harry Potter but each time I love it and am transported all over again. ‚ù§Ô∏è Beautiful wording and imagery! Will read them again and again.
4434,5,Great book,I loved it it was my first time reading in excited to finish reading the rest of the series !!
4435,5,Great book!,What can I say that you don't already know?  Gift for a 9 year old girl who is just discovering the world of Harry Potter.  Love them all!
4436,5,Great,Story telling at its best. It is an easy read for most ages. I intend to read the series. Mischief managed
4437,5,Amazing Read,"This is probably my 15th time reading this and it gets better every time!! I highly recommend for anyone who loves tales of bravery, friendship and perseverance with magic all rolled into one!!"
4438,5,The boy who lived will save your family,The story of a boy who saved the wizard world as a baby. Just buy it
4439,5,Faithful,Awesome!
4440,4,Harry Potter is a Winner,"I know that everyone has probably read the book, watched the movie, heard the music...but I just love the audio book.  It gives the story a whole new depth.  Jim Dale does a great job (although some of his pronunciations differ some what from what we're used to).  It really brings the book to life.  Since the movie couldn't cover the whole content of the book, the audio book does a great job.  You can still use your own imagination while listening to the book.  I love you J. K.  I just can't wait for the next movie to come out...and of course, the final book!!!"
4441,5,Great book,Loved the book!!!!
4442,5,I will always be a potterhead,"This is like the fourth time I read Harry Potter 1 and I always find something new, please encourage kids to read, they can learn about friendship, corurage, love."
4443,5,It arrived quickly and in good condition. I loved it so much I just ...,I ordered this book a while back and have read it 3 times.  It arrived quickly and in good condition.I loved it so much I just ordered and received the new illustrated version.  It's about as big as my MacBook Air and I just started reading it.I have done a separate review for it.
4444,5,better than the movie,I thought the movie was great this book is better There are so many details that a movie just can't get into.Read this to learn what the movie left out or changed  You will enjoy it
4445,5,A favorite among many,"Good classic reading and it seems like it's a good style for kids. I heard that things get a little darker later on, so I'm probably going to read through the first three."
4446,5,It is an amazing story and just sucks you into it. You won't want to put it down !,"The story is so fascinating, you are captured by the suspense of what will happen next! The character line is amazing and you can really feel the characters emotions."
4447,5,"An extremely good book, one to remember.","Harry Potter, I got this book as a Christmas present opened it up and kept my nose in it non-stop. An exelent book with plenty of imagination. It is full of exictement and a very good plot. I think J.K. Rowling should be and  will be remembered along with many other great authors. I recomend thios  book for anyone not just for 9-12 year olds but anyone. If you need a book  get Harry Potter."
4448,3,Peach cds,The color of the CDs is a weird peach color. I was disappointed with copy recieved. It almost appears as if its a knock of version or pirated.
4449,5,"Good book, fast shipping",My daughter needed this to read in her class. my husband stood in front of the teacher ordered the book and within two days she was riding along with the rest of her classmates.
4450,4,Rhys's Review,I liked reading about Fluffy. There isn't much to dislike about this book. I'd definitely recommend this book to other young readers.
4451,5,Love it!,My daughter loves this!  She can't put the book down and will read the whole series as I had promised her I would take her to Universal Studios after she finishes.
4452,3,Good quality,I only give 3 stars because this was not what was described when I purchased it. It had a description of a different cover than the one I received but the book itself is very well put together for a paper back
4453,5,Love this book!!,My favorite Harry Potter book!! My students love to hear it and they are always excited to see what will happen next.
4454,3,Disappointing -- so far...,"It may be that I expected too much. It may be that I'll end up liking these books. However, there are things illogical that do not belong in any book, fantasy or not, such as someone trying to pound a nail with fruit cake. I realize this book is for young people, but I agree with C. S. Lewis  who said, ""Any book that is not worthy of an adult, is not worthy of  children."" There are even little picky things, such as using words  such as ""tap"" or ""wham,"" as if this is a comic strip.  Ms. Rowling has a marvelous imagination, but I could wish there had been a  bit more creative editing. You cannot know how disappointed I am in this  first volume of the series."
4455,5,Great Read!,A great escape book.  To live in another world for a short time!Remembering the different sound and unfamiliar names was a good brain exercise.
4456,5,Jim Dale makes a perfect narrator,"Being a huge fan of the books, I was a little sceptical about getting the audio version. I love hearing and visualizing in my own mind as I read. I have to say that Jim Dale is wonderful on this and the other recordings. He really brings the characters to life, and his flexible voice changes for each character. Highly recommended for traveling or those who have a hard time reading printed books."
4457,5,New excellent condition,I loved these books in my 20s when I read them and now it‚Äôs time to pass the love onto my nephew. Book was in excellent condition
4458,5,Thank you!,Nice book!
4459,5,Good Condition,"It was a used book as described it in title, so with that being said it has a little wear on it from the previous owner , but overall it is in great condition no missing pages or stains. I am satisfied."
4460,5,The Best!,I definitely think you should read! If you like long reads and magic get this book right now! Read it!
4461,5,beautiful book,"We all know and love this story. In this special anniversary addition,  the publishers have included a beautiful painting of Hagrid and the First Years crossing the lake by Mary GrandPre as well as a hand drawn sketch of Snape by J.K. Rowling herself. The dust cover art is of Harry looking into the Mirror of Erised (my favorite chapter). The book itself is covered in Gryffindor house colors -- scarlet with gold stars all over it. I'm looking forward to collecting all seven anniversary editions for my home library."
4462,5,The audio speaker is to die for,You feel like you are there. Close your eyes and enjoy.
4463,4,Great book.,Filled in missing parts of the movies.
4464,5,Solid writing; Ease on American linguistics.,"So far, so good! I‚Äôve seen all of the films, of course, but had never read the books. Rowling does a superb job of making English writing readable for Americans who don‚Äôt often encounter or read London cockney."
4465,5,AMAZING BOOK!,It was ruined because no packing was used!
4466,5,It‚Äôs a book lol,Book wasn‚Äôt damaged or stained .Has that new book smell ! omg love
4467,5,Harry Potter series is my all time favorite series. I don't know how many times I've ...,Harry Potter series is my all time favorite series.  I don't know how many times I've read this but several times I know.  I do not read any book (except Little Women) more than once
4468,5,Replaced a lost one in our set.,Bought yo replace my missing volume. A little smaller but gone for our purposes.
4469,5,Great,Great
4470,5,good story,great imagination she has
4471,5,Awesome story,Read this book over ten times. It's still awesome to read. I will probably reread it several more times. THANK YOU JK
4472,5,Nothing not to love,I love all the Harry Potter books and have had them in paperback since I was a kid but finally started replacing them with hardback copies. I love the different cover art for this one. It arrived in perfect condition.
4473,5,AMAZING!,"This is the first time I have ever read Harry Potter. It is also the first time I finished a book on the kindle App. I will definitely be busy reading all the other books in the series. Oh, and watching all the movies as well. This was by far one of the most exciting adventures I have read about. It ranks up there with the Lord of the Rings series. I felt as though I was at Hogwarts the whole time I was reading. Couldn‚Äôt be more pleased and satisfied with a book."
4474,5,Finally,I‚Äôm finally reading Harry Potter. This book came out when I was in 7th grade but I never really got into them. Loved it now on to the next book!
4475,5,Magical,Every word in this book and the series is magically the best series of all time. I would definitely read it again and again.
4476,5,"Fun, Fresh and Exciting to read to your child!","My seven year old daughter and I are thoroughly enjoying this book. I have read the book through because I couldn't wait to see what happens myself. It is a fun, heartwarming book that is so imaginative I smile when I think  of it. We can't wait to read the sequels. What a pleasant way to put my  daughter to bed each night. Thank you Ms. Rowling! Imagination and  Creativity and Excitement  begin to describe this great book. I'd say the  age levels should be 7 on up!"
4477,5,Classic!,This was an excellent read. If you haven't yet please do so. Its not just a kids book I promise. Its so much more.
4478,3,Beware legal guardians who not allow this to be read ...,Beware legal guardians who not allow this to be read in their home. No one should ever stop a kid from reading what they want.
4479,5,Order from them,Perfect condition
4480,5,Great story!,"This book is a great start to any fantasy reader. I know I am late to the party on reading this but I truly enjoyed the story about friendship, magic, and everything in between. I highly recommend this novel."
4481,4,Nostalgic,"The writing isn't as spectacular as I remember it to be, but the book is still entertaining and holds a special place in my heart."
4482,5,Great book.,Haven‚Äôt read this book in many many years. Still good and wish I was back at Disney for butter beer
4483,5,"Buy it, buy them all",Best. Series. Ever.
4484,2,Weary,It was really weary
4485,5,Bought for niece,"Bought this for my niece, she loves to read. Came in perfect condition"
4486,5,Best book ever,I liked every word in this book. I totally recommend this book to anyone who likes dragons or magic. I think that anyone would love this book just as I did
4487,5,Awesome Read,"Seen the movie, but reading the book with all the original detail without the movie edits and deletions is much better. Now I have to read the rest of them!"
4488,5,fire,it‚Äôs good and i like it and it was good and fun and i liked it and it was fun
4489,5,Great book,Quality book and a great story.  Binding is not Beagle Proof but held together even after he attack!
4490,3,"Nothing Spectacular to Merit the Hype About this ""Anniversary Edition""","Belatedly I found out that this is not worth buying. Yes, I bought the book because I thought that being touted as the 10th Anniversary Edition, it would be SPECIAL. Like there would be at least a Reflection page by Scholastic or JKR since the book (and the obscure author) has been a huge success. However, the contents are basically the same. The only additional is the sketch of Snape by JKR with a small note regarding the sketch plus the colored frontis of Hagrid on the boat...yes, the dust jacket has a new art and the boards are red with golden stars...but that's about it.If you collect the books though, as in because you want every copy of the HP book series, then what I just said won't matter. But if you're buying it because you think it offers something new, then I would say it is not worth it."
4491,5,Great book love it best series I've read in my entire life. All around great book.,Amazing book really good for all ages. I love the book so much I have re-read it 10 times. Amazing book.
4492,5,A classic!,Amazing. This is an amazing book for all ages!Not one year olds tho !! Hope you enjoy as much as me!
4493,3,The story of an ordinary boy who finds out  he is a wizard.,"This book is competantly written and compares well with most children's books written today. BUT for plot, interesting magical events,  character development, and interesting dialog it cannot compare with E. Nesbit's,  Edward Eager's nor with C.S. Lewis's books! (for example: The Enchanted  Castle by E. Nesbit, Half Magic by Edward Eager, and the Narnia Series by  Lewis.)"
4494,5,Harry Potter,I am a 66 year old woman.  I just read this book for the first time.  Very interesting story.  I like the way the main characters communicated with each other.  I had no unanswered questions at the end of the book.
4495,5,Worth it,Great quality. Great price!
4496,5,5 stars,My son absolutely loves this book!Good quality!!

4502,5,Harry Potter series here we come,Wife‚Äôs wanted this series for a while. Great price for a brand new hardcover. I‚Äôll be buying her the rest of the series too.
4503,5,"Easy, fast transaction",My daughter loved the Harry Potter books and is now reading them to her 6 and 7 year olds.?This is the only book she didn‚Äôt have .
4504,5,"I have had about 10 copies of this book, ...","I have had about 10 copies of this book,the first one my sister sent me from England. I taught in an inner city school.where the kids had not been read aloud to very often. I read a chapter a day to my classes every day. When I started to read Harry 1 the children were entranced. So much so that the book was stolen many times each year . So I started buying paper backs. which have fallen apart. that is why I ordered this copy.. Now  I read it to my grandchildren."
4505,5,One of the Best All-Time Story Series!,The first Harry Potter book pulls readers into a wonderful world. This was a gift to complete a set for a person who had worn out her paperback copies.
4506,5,Meet Harry Potter,"Who would have known a story about a little boy living under a cupboard named Harry Potter would become an international best-seller?  HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCER'S STONE is the first novel in a 7 book series that introduces the reader to an amazing world of magic.The novel begins with Harry living with his aunt and uncle, the Dursleys.  Ever since Harry was dropped off at the Dursley's front doorstep 10 years ago, the Dursleys along with their hefty son, Dudley, have made his life almost unbearable.  It is not until a letter arrives, written with emerald-green ink, addressed for Harry Potter--The Cupboard under the Stairs--does Harry's life begin to radically change.That's when a giant named Hagrid visits Harry and reveals to him, against the wishes of the Dursley's, that he is a wizard.  After Harry purchases all his school material from Diagon Alley, he leaves platform nine and three-quarters straight to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Harry also learns he is famous, world renown, in the magical universe because of his faceoff with You-Know-Who, Voldemort!  Woops, I didn't say that!The reader, for the first time, is teased in this novel with such unforgettable characters and stunning ideas that become much more prominent as the series plays out: Hogwarts, Dumbledore, Voldemort, Quidditch, Professor Snape, Professor McGonagall, Draco Malfoy, the Invisibility Cloak, Gryffindor, etc.J.K. Rowling's writing ability, imagination, and intuitive grasp of human nature gives her characters a depth that resonates in the core of the reader.  Harry, along with his best friends, Hermione and Ron, are so in tune, emotionally intact with one another that it makes the story so much more alive.  Before Harry knows it, his first year at Hogwarts involves not only learning magic but figuring out how to keep the Sorcerer's Stone from getting in the wrong hands.This novel is a classic that will initiate the reader into a world of mystery.  The characters are so emotionally developed they become real in your heart.  It is a story so good and well thought out that it urges you to read on to the end."
