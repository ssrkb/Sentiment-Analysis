0,3,Average Mic Quality,"I am using this neck band about past 12 days and writing my review. I used this earphone with bike travel,  pubg , alone in room, noisy crowded places and in office. i am writing this review from my own perspective. Medium level of volume (60%) is enough for me through the day for call and music and it have charge upto one and half day.1.Good audio quality-  4/52.Decent Bass - 4/53.Good battery backup  - 4/54.Quality material -  5/55.Ergonomics - 4.5/56.Mic - 2/57.Gaming - 4.5/5.Everything in this product is fine until online call comes. It have two mic on the headphone. i don't know which one is pickup the noise in online call. when we use this headphone for online calls the mic works absolutely terrible for me. It is very responsive and pickup the tiny noise very far from the mic and not picking up my voice. i tried with wtsapp, Duo,Skype and Zoom call. It is frustrating for me all the times.I checked with one of my colleague's earphone it do have the same issue as mine.Noise cancellation during bike drive works is still not up to satisfying. it work sometimes and most of the time the opponent hear only wind noise. I tried to block the wind by placing the neckband below my shirt's collar,, still wind noise is there. Apart from that, the mic works decent in normal calls.During PUBG, i don't feel any latency issue with this and also no audio or mic issue."
1,1,Received opened box,"I received package but in box I got a broken data cable. Amazon again defaulter with its service.After got my refund, I purchased it from local shop. I impressed with its design and flexibility around the neck. Sound also great. But with in 15 days left side part stopped working and this time I surprised because I'm the person who cares alot of my products. One plus service center changed it and provide me a new earphone.If you are thinking to purchase it..no doubt it's a great product.It's produced a balance sound that's all."
2,2,"If you know even little about a music should sound , you won't like it.","Overall a good earphone but not a good sounding headphone.If you're looking for anything that sounds good, has natural lows , warm and and deep mids, sparkling and clear highs ? Go for anything but not this. Soundstage wise , they're horrible, bass is artificial, there is absolutely no imaging. The depth in the audio sounds like a 8bit Audio played on 1995 Walkman. Highs are absolutely absent. This is just very very bad sounding headphone.But, if you don't care about Audio Quality in the Music and like anything that has good battery, charges superfast, sleek and well built, produces stupid bass for IDK what reason. Then you might like it.I don't like it and I won't recommend it. (Tested on 24bit 96khz FLAC/ALAC files)"
3,5,Balanced earphone with great build quality worth buying!!,This is my second purchase of this earphone. This is a great earphone.Pros-------Great sound quality (4/5)Bass is excellent (5/5)Call quality (5/5) - so far nobody complained about my calls and it is crystal clear.Noise cancellation good (4/5)Comfort in the ears (4/5) - please choose the earbuds according to your comfort. The small one looked more comfortable for me.Battery backup is excellent (5/5) - You can easily get 12-15 hours of playback/call time.Magnet ON/OFF switch is great - this helps in not using the battery when magnetic switch is paired. With medium to heavy usage the battery last for 3+ days easily.Fast pairing is great.Build quality is excellentCons-------No switch for pairing with multiple devices. You need to manually do this.Even though the earbuds are comfortable you may feel slight discomfort after using it for longer period continuously.Highly recommended for anybody who is looking for a decent Bluetooth headset.
4,5,"Good sound but no noise cancellation,","Built - good built as expected, band is soft silicone, one side three button control with charging port which shockingly have no cover on it, all other cheaper alternative have.Connection - no issues fast seamless,Sound - main features is sound quality, as it is bass edition, so mote than enough bass, compared to other owned earbuds like cross beats evolve not as par to it, it sound like a SMALL SPEAKER IS SOUNDING A FULL SOUND, whereas boat rokerz 385v2 sound like a big home theatre system sounding, and sound is not balanced as it is bass edition.Bass, mids, vocals can heard clearly and separately but quality not up towards crossbeats.Charging - super fast,Verdict - other alternative at cheaper price bracket like boat, noise can be recommended over this."
5,3,Product has manufacturing defect.,"After one month of use, honest review.Everything is good sound, battery backup, connectivity, look and noise cancelation but Chinese product remains Chinese.Sorry to say but the volume, play/pause button fell off suddenly somewhere while neckband was in my ear and it shows no sign before so that I could have fixed it.It just fell off.Everything still works fine but I don't have buttons to increase/decrease volume, play or pause In neck band."
6,1,DOWNGRADED  features!!,"In the previous model, we could easily switch between two connected devices. While hearing  TV / laptop/ ipad output on the Bluetooth, one could switch to the phone or any other connected device  with just a double click on the power button. This was such a super useful feature of this device in the previous version. THE NEW MODEL DOES NOT  HAVE THAT OPTION!! I tried  all possibilities and read through the manual.. No .. NOT AVAILABLE!! This is. Ridiculous and feel so cheated.. how could they strip off such an important and very USEFUL feature!  I am appalled and deeply disappointed.  Can‚Äôt return it.. only replacement is allowed. !! How could the company be so stupid and thoughtless."
7,5,Battery hulk,"Excellent headphones. I use them a lot - listening to podcasts when I'm pottering, music when I'm running, for every phone call and video conference. The ...The warp charging is amazing - combined with the automatic off when they dangle round your neck (magnetic buds), it means I just never run out of battery. 10 mins of charging keeps them going for a couple of days of use for me.They connect to my phone automatically and very quickly when I snap them apart. A button on the neck band switches the connection quickly to my laptop and back.Sound quality is excellent and they're pretty comfy. The fit in my ear isn't quite as good as I've had with some other in-ear headphones, but they stay in well enough for use on long cross-country runs."
8,5,You are immediately in Dreamland or Wonderland,When you want to dream about something while watching videos or PRETENDING TO BE SEEING THE NEWS AND STUDYING.IT'S AN EXCELLENT WAY TO GET YOUR OWN SENSES DOING WHAT YOU WANT OR YOUR BRAIN WANTS TO DO... USE THESE HEADPHONES... WOW.. I WAS IMPRESSED BY THE QUALITY OF THE TREBLE MIDRANGE AND BASS SOUNDS AND THE SOUND OF THE AUDIENCE IN THE LIVE MUSIC VIDEOS... BUT YOU TEND TO DREAM MORE THAN WORK.. IF YOU TOTAL YOUR WORK AFTERWARDS WHEN THE MUSIC STOPS... üéßüç∑üí≠üé∂üéµüéºüò≥üëÄ..THAT'S SOUND SCIENCE TOO GOOD KEEP IT UP... WOW...
9,4,Just amazing!!!! Very happy with these,"Pros:Best in class sound and great bassGood for all music genresReasonable priceGood balance of mids, lows. The upper highs are little muffed and could be a problem for hard rock lovers. But you can make any headphones work as per your needs with the equalizer on your device.Cons:One star less because they didn‚Äôt put the quick switch button on these ones. The old ones without the bass edition had a quick switch button. I can live with that but the convenience is missing in these ones. My solution press and hold the middle button and then switch in the mobile device for connecting."
10,3,Overall Good product but When travelling Outdoors the Noise Cancellation is almost Zero.,Overall Good product but When travelling Outdoors the Noise Cancellation is almost Zero.Firstly Dont buy this product if you always use it Outdoors because the Noise Cancellation is Almost Zero.The opponent cant hear your Voice clearly because of Background Noise.Apart from This the Earphones are amazing in terms if Sound Quality.
11,2,FLIMSY PRODUCT,"Though the sound/bass quality is good, the product is very unreliable and flimsy. Right side buds stopped working within 2 days of purchase. Also, there was a cracking noise heard during phonecalls which is very disturbing. Got a free replacement from Amazon as per their policy. The replaced product also had the same issues. Was denied another round of replacement by Amazon, thus had to visit a OnePlus exclusive service center. They took more than a week's time and gave a replacement which they claimed to be a new product. These ""new"" earphones won't get charged and are unusable. OnePlus is not offering pickup-drop service for repair due some technical issues. Highly disappointed with the entire turn of events and experience. Total waste of time and money."
12,2,Third grade quality,All thos Mother!@#$%^&* who aporeciated this one plus product mast have done it for paid.its no where near to realme earphone which comes in 1799 ..only problem with realme earphone is that its wire used to break from the main machine ...or else i would have bought realme earphone for third time in 2 years....but i bought this One plus product in 2000 rupees which is just a trash .One plus is useless earphone
13,5,Best in the class.,"It is good in all aspects. I purchased 4 numbers of OnePlus Bullets Bluetooth Wireless Z Bass Edition in Ear Earphones with Mic (Black) for me and my friends. The performance of the sets is good and the battery charge is sufficient for the full day. For one of the sets, Magnet was dropped and lost somewhere after 10 months of usage. Replacement is denied as the magnet is not found. Another set stopped pairing after 2 Months. Oneplus service center replaced it with a new set on my request."
14,5,Awesome,"This the replacement of the fault one. I bought for fire time to gift my wife and eventually it failed to work within two days. But I crossed the replacement period. Still after explaining Amazon representative, they accepted to replace and provide me a new one. I mean, the Amazon representative guy was very helpful. The replacement one is working excellent. Thank you Amazon"
15,5,Worth the price!,"This is the best bluetooth earphone I have ever used. Unmatched sound quality, ease switch between songs / connecting or disconnecting calls.The best thing about this is the battery back up. Literal 5-10 minutes of charging would give a 100% charge.  Although it depends on the usage, but a moderate use can still make the battery last for 3-4 days. I love the magnet at the end of the earbuds to save the chare.You don't need to think twice before getting this one if you are looking to buy a good quality bluetooth earphones."
16,4,A balanced Bluetooth earphone in this price!!,"This review I am writing after 1 month usage. Firstly let me say that I am a moderate user of this item. I used this Bluetooth headset for calls, audios and music.Pros:1. One plus being an elite brand has tried to maintain a decent quality of the product.2. Bass & Treble performance - deep bass delivery is satisfactory. High pitched notes could be made better. I am a fan of Jagjit Singh and his ghazals were all upto my satisfactory levels.3. Tried it using inside trains. At 75% volume level outside noises were mostly eleminated. Outdoor ambient noise was also blocked when used during brisk walking or trolling. Choice of volume level is upto the hearing perception of an user. So I am not commenting more on this.4. Call reception quality is good enough.5. If you use it at night in a dark room with some classical songs playing....simply you will love to continue to play.6. Lastly the sound delivery does not distort even at higher volumes which is a great positive factor to me.7. Battery backup is satisfactory. It never runs out of charge. After 2 hrs of listening charge dips 10% only which is acceptable.Cons:1. It could be made a bit sturdy at this price.2. The thin round wires coming out from the headband will tend to tear at that place because it is a weak joint. It could be made better.Overall if you can spare a bit much from the ranges around 1100-1300 then this won't turn you down. I am happy using this item as of now.Choice is yours. Best of luck."
17,4,Good but chose it carefully.,"The product is good overall..1, Battery : The battery life is best. It really gives 10 hours charge with 10 minutes charge. It has fast charging facility. For battery, there is nothing to worry.2, Sound and bass: It has high bass..But I personally don't like it for the bass. If you are a music lover, you can feel the vocals and other instrumental sound are slightly distorted for the bass, I say slightly, not so high .If you want a balanced audio stay away from it, or you can use the regular edition. But if you are a bass lover, thats a perfect option for you. And I feel a little crack audio while listening to music. That's can be for my phone problem, because, when I connect it with my laptop, there is no such problem. So, I think to return it.  There is no quick switch option in the bass edition.  That may be helpful for you to buying it."
18,5,Super product,"Nice sound amazing productSo coming from a quality wired earphones to this neck band (RIP headphone jack) this wireless band cant bridge that gap.PROS-Awesome battery life,Great quick switch functionality (not available in BASE EDITION, great job one plus marketing team),Quality phone calls (get it immediately of u spend long time in meetings or calls) WFH Fever,Type C and fast charge (minor but still its there)Even the band to ear bud wire length is different.. had difficulty in position with my shirt collar. BASE EDITION legth is not enought. Stupid company. Had to return Bass Edition due to removal of quick switch and reduced ear cord length.CONS--Music will become less enjoyable so buyer beware,BASE EDITION-Music does feel good but one plus cleverly REMOVED the QUICK SWITCH and even positioned the MICROPHONE on the neck band directly while in NORMAL EDITION it used to be on the control island thingy with volume.Any physical changes must be highlighted. Guess one plus no longer enthusiast brand."
19,3,Good product with limitations,"I like the prduct due to its sound quality and the amout of noise cancellation that it provides at this price point.However, online meetings at laptops and computers revealed an potential issue with this. If you are infront of the laptop (may be within 2-3 feet) other will not notice any issue. As soon as you move beyond that you are not audible or your voice will decrease significantly for others in the call, forcing you to maintain the very small radius. This negates the purpose of having  Bluetooth headphones.So, for cellphone its ok but for office meetings you will face issues."
20,3,"Not up to the name, Not for bass lovers","I purchased it as its one plus brand, connectivity is good, calling is also nice, but if you are bass lover, you will be highly disappointed. Sometimes sound goes creepy as well. It looses the quality a bit. If there‚Äôs any return option I would like to return it.In the same price range you‚Äôll get better neck bands."
21,2,Not a good experience,I purchased this for my poco X2 phone and the first was not connecting with my phone and if connects then disconnect automatically and will not connect again for hours then after restarting multiple times it will connect again so I went for replacement. I got replacement and there was no connectivity issue but when I am on call there is always some static background noise and it was so bad and loud that I had to return the product.
22,4,Best neck band under INR 3000/-,"Recently I had to retire my Jabra elite 25e after 3 years of usage, before that I used Samsung level u for 2 years. After a lot of research, I have ordered Blue Parrott M300XT which is a big disappointment for INR4300/- (Not from Amazon)No battery backup (2.5 hrs against claimed 14 hrs), faulty model, ear pain, heating issues, low volume.My gamble to try a new model has failed and instantly I had to look for a reliable neckband under INR 2000/- as I have already burnt my hands. Oh boy! Oneplus has not disappointed.Pros:-1. Instant pairing attach and detach2. Good environmental noise cancellation even at 60% volume3. Quick charging4. good range (This something very tough to comment)5. Detach to answer the call feature is great6. Comfortable earplugs (Jabra Elite25e and Samsung levelu I had ear fatigue)7.  Lightweight and adequate wire length.Cons:-1. Should have included a mute button (only jabra elite models have it)Verdict:- If you are looking for a no-fuss comfortable reliable neck band go for it.Oppo M31 has less battery and Real Me buds earplugs are big, Level U is bulky.So ONEPLUS BULLETS WIRELESS BASS Edition is an allrounder for INR 2000/-Don't expect a noise-cancelling mic like Poly Voyager 5200 it's made for different use case."
23,2,Not as Expected,"Sound, Bass and Noise Cancellation are excellent but the battery backup is not as mentioned in the production description so it's a wastage of money as it doesn't meet the expectations. I suggest all not to buy this product with the price of ‚Çπ1999. I also returned this after finishing the battery backup issue.This product worth only ‚Çπ700 not more. Microphone is also not working, sometimes it stops working in between."
24,5,Absolutely worth it!,"""Bass boosted"" is upto its name.Absolutely fantastic sound quality, noise cancellation etc, especially with a oneplus phone the compatibility is just amazing!With non OnePlus phones, experience might not be the best, all cool features don't work as well."
25,5,For 2000 can't complain,"It is the best under 2000 for calls, music and gaming but if you compare it with high end earbuds like Sony XB-WF700 then those will blow this out of water in sound quality and rich bass. In these bass is high sound quality is ok but in high end earbuds it's not crystal clear. Don't think that these sound crappy no no these sound good and for 2000 these are the best value for money."
26,2,Mic placement is not good,"Pros: Lightweight & Fast-chargingCons: Sound clarity, Bass, Microphone placement, Battery Backup& Build Quality.P.S. Earlier  non-bass edition was very good. This version is bad. I don‚Äôt recommend."
27,4,Buy without any second thought. Compatible with iPhone7 (Bluetooth V. 4.0),"Writing this review after using it for 15 days. I am using it by paired with iPhone7 and believe me it is one of the best neck band, I have found.iPhone7 has Bluetooth version 4.0 and in some reviews I read it is compatible with Bluetooth 5.0 and latest versions. But, I haven't yet faced any single issue related to connectivity or latency in voice.Hats off to its battery life. In 15 days I have charged it for twice only.I was very confused before buying it due to review I found here, but believe me and buy it without any second thought."
28,1,This was my worst choice ever.,"So, I replaced my original bullet wireless bass edition when I noticed this issue and to my surprise the new replacement had the same issue. I, then, replaced this second earphone too and the third one had the same problem again. OnePlus sent me new earphones in a sealed pack every time so I'm sure it was not the same piece.With this third piece I tried all the troubleshooting possible. From resetting the network setting to resetting my one plus 7 but nothing worked. This earphone was working all fine with other phones. I tried this with my friends Oneplus 7, hoping that it would not work, but it was working fine with his phone. Even other bluetooth earphones like Sony WI-C200, boat rockerz 335 etc are working fine with my phoneThe only possible answer is that only few devices has this wireless connectivity issue with bullets bass edition version. I cannot think of anything else.TL;DR There is no solution for this issue.Workaround I've purchased the one plus bullets normal version ( not the bass edition) and this earphone works flawlessly with my phone. tbh, the normal version is better than the bass edition becuase of the handy quick switch button and for the bass, its almost the same.I'd suggest all of you to get the normal version (not the bass edition) or any other bluetooth earphone you like."
29,5,Best in this range,Earphone built quality is excellent. It's comfortable to use. Not feeling any irritation on neck. I bought black colour it looks standard and perfect. Sound quality is impressive. Bass is superb. No problem in phone calling. I will recommend to buy it. Also OnePlus has history of durability. Satisfied with this purchase. With full charge it can used for 8-9 hours continues call. Mic quality is impressive during call.
30,1,Faulty product received,"I was order this product as birthday gift to my wife. I was order this 13 days before my wife's birthday. I received it within 3 days. After I keep it as it is in a safe place without  open this. On birthday I present it to wife. She is happy but after 1 day. She complaint me this product is faulty after That I tryed to return but Amazon's 10 day return policy is over so I contact to OnePlus service center. Service said to me first they test to this product for 3 days and then they deside to replace or not. I have no choice but want to say to OnePlus service center, ""this is a very bad customer service.""  Also in future I never buy OnePlus's any product. Good bye OnePlus."
31,3,"Decent Wireless earphones, surely not the best in the segment !","I am using this product for quite a few months now and here are some points I‚Äôd like to mention:Connectivity : Really good üëç 4/5 (no switch option avlb!)Comfy level: Very light üçÉ 5/5Sound quality: Mids(3/5) | Highs(2/5) | Bass(1.5/5 - Extra bass my ass üòÇ)Battery: 3.5/5 Will easily last 5-6hr on heavy use.Overall experience: 2.5/5‚úÖ Good for regular use if  sound/mic quality is not your concern.‚ö†Ô∏è Not recommended for audiophiles!‚õîÔ∏è MAJOR CON ü•≤: The product is defective, one may hear crackling sound from time to time specially while changing volume.Had returned the product and the new one was no different.Solution(Weird / Temporary):1> Change volume repeatedly  until sound input is totally gone üòÇ and then simply forget the device and re-pair. This may  work for a few hrs.2> Get use to it üòÇ"
32,5,Good sound signature and ok call quality,"Sound signature is goodBalanced bass and good sound clarity2 day battery backup(4-5 hours of usage per day)Call quality is good but the environment noise is not reduced, even it picks up noise from 10ft away.There are sometime the headphone is not connecting to iPhone automatically but connects to laptop automatically."
33,5,Really love it!,"I have received a product with very good packing. As usual one plus box is beautifully designed for its customers. Here are some pros and consPros:- Premium Packaging- Bass and Trible quality is awesome- Elegant design- Stylish look- Quality is awesome wrt price- Quick pairing esp when you are using oneplus device- Supports Type C charger and quick chargingCons:- Should improve the wire quality of Right and left earphones- Should have provided the carrying pouchI really love this amazing product ! Can't expect oneplus would provide quality product with awesome sound quality at this price. Previously I have used Bose Soundsport, Galaxy buds+ Jabra 65T and out of all Bose Soundsport is one of the best headphones and Oneplus is now in that vision."
34,1,Damaged and used product,"This product doesn't even deserves one star , however , Amazon only allow us to provide minimum of one star.Excellent features provided by this product are listed below.1. USED PRODUCT(FOUND EAR WAX IN BUDS)2. DEFECTIVE PRODUCT3. PLENTY OF SCRATCHES(SEEMS LIKE USED  BY AN ANIMAL)4. THE EDGES ARE JOINED USING FEVIKWIK (  IT IS CLEARLY VISIBLE IN THE POSTED  IMAGE)5.

35,4,Good product after initial hiccups,"After receiving the earphone today, 1st impression of sound quality was bad as i was there was crackling sound when listening to YouTube video songs in Mackbook Pro. But when tried in Pixel phone, it was all clear. Tried in 2 other devices and audio was clear without any crackling noise. So it got clear that earphones are good, problem is in bluetooth in Macbook Pro which after reading some online resolution, got fixed (deleted bluetooth related .plist file from Library -> Preference folder and restarted the Mac). So now i am enjoying these lovely earphones. So far so good.Build quality is good. These are so light weight that one won't even notice that its around neck when worn for longer time. Switching devices is smooth even without dedicated switch button. Call quality is also Ok. Battery life not tested yet but fast charging really works. Wish they provided a longer USB-C cable, its very tiny."
36,1,Good,"Sound Quality: GoodConnectivity: not up to mark, looks like it's not Bluetooth V5Working great with OnePlus 6, qual quality too bad with poco F1Music quality good with all devices I useBattery n charging: GreatI'd go for Infinity 120 for connectivity ( I can connect two phones at the same time)For battery: OnePlus hands downNote: I've used both, I enjoyed infinity more for half the priceI had requested for replacement of my copy, Amazon didn't process my requestSad times"
37,3,Read this and buy,Product works fine. But there is some technical prob. In description they mentioned like we can pair with multiple devices and we can switch among them.  But that won't happen. We have to do that manually from ur connected device. And it won't switch. It get disconnect from the paired device then it will connect with another device.
38,4,"Good for calls, convenience and casual music listening. Not for critical music listener.",I expected better sound quality for such a price point. The build quality is good but sound did not do for me. The bass overshadowed the rest of the music due to which the sound seemed a bit muffled.Still I would recommend for the casual music listener but not to someone whose priority is sound quality and music detailing.
39,4,"Clear Sound with comfort , lacks Bass","Oneplus bullet wireless Z Bass Edition is really good product in terms of its sound quality and the kind of comfort that  its material provide is unique at this price point but what is disappointing overall is the BASS which is still not up to the mark as compared to other earphones in this price segment,  battery backup is good gives usage upto 14-15 hrs on 70% volume, connection is fine, you can go for it if you just need a  clear sound and Not if you're a music enthusiast.I'm giving this review after using it for 15 days"
40,1,"Not suitable for call ,total waste of money.. don't buy it","It works fine for music but whenever you want to make a call there is a cracking sound coming from it. I replaced one but the next one is also showing the same problem, they have managed to produce a damaged product , it's their in built fault and they are not going to fix it until and unless someone filled a complaint at consumer court and make them pay for their dishonest business.."
41,4,Everything is good except poor noise cancelation. Noise cancelation is very poor.,"Review after 2 months of use:1. Battary back up is good.2. Charging speed and feasibility to charge are good. 10-15 min charge can sustain your day.3. Connectivity with paired device is good, pairing is fast.4. Switching between 2 devices could have been better and fast.5. Call quality (Specially the noise cancelation) is worst and of very poor quality. It won't cancel any noise and any environmental noise and background voice will always be very loud and hearable at the other end of call.If calling is not the purpose then it will be very good choice to buy."

43,5,Thanks to One+ for the innovation of this Z bass edition.,"1. It's really very light weight neckband, even you forget after few times that you have it on your neck.2. Balanced Sound quality and bass quality superb.3. Its build up quality superb.4. Noise cancellation really works superb in this neck band.5. Battery backup is also superb.Overall after 5 days experience I am completely satisfied and happy with this neckband.Thanks to One+ for the innovation of this Z bass edition."
44,1,MIC doesn't WORK,"Please don't buy this. This earphones mic doesn't work at all. I bought two and noticed it after a few weeks, sadly otherwise I would have returned it right away. I googled and found out that so many users are facing the same issue. Its like the microphone doesn't EXIST and that's not all there are these random popping/cracking noise while listening to music etc. Please don't buy this."
45,1,Weak bass treble nd noise cancellation,"Mic not work properly during callNoise cancellation very weakNot getting good sound outcome as relted to price comparisionBass also normal soft nd feel bass not come only simple hard one, treble ratio also not match properly relate to bass to enjoy musicDont go for it select any other"
46,1,Don't Buy This Product,Although the sound and bass is good - there is one MAJOR PROBLEM the headphone gets disconnected frequently (I'm using OnePlus Nord) and it's very irritating that every 5-10mins I need to reconnect headphone and my phone inbetween my calls or when I'm watching a movie. And now even exchange window has closed to add to my issue. My suggestion Don't Buy This Product
47,3,connection on/off system is pathetic,Magnet of both ear buds joints Bluetooth connection gets off means disconnects from device and when you separate it reconnect to the device but it takes some time and after using 5 days now its not reconnecting. I have to go to Bluetooth section and connect it again and again. I have factory reset it but same thing happening. When i have call i put buds in my ear and wait till its connect with my phone then i need receive call from phone of switch given on handsfree. It would be better if magnetic call receive/cut system developed instead of magnetic power on/off system because magnetic power on/off system takes time to reconnect and we have to go for receive call. Device switch system is too pathetic every time you need to go for connect. sound quality is really good.
48,1,Failed product,"So i ordered my first headset two days back and I am a person who uses YouTube extensively every day. I bought this OnePlus bullets wireless z bass edition earphones with lots of hope, the first 10minutes the headphone worked fine but right after that there was this crackling sound coming from the earphone which sounded like some static noise. Decided to return it back and got a replacement just half an hour before the time I am writing this review and again I am facing the same issue. Guess OnePlus failed to manufacture a reliable and result delivering product. I guess OnePlus must take this flaw as its not just me but several people have complained about this issue on the OnePlus forum too. I wish to return this one too as my main usage is for YouTube and this crackling sound is highly irritating while watching videos. PS: I AM NO EXPERT ON ONEPLUS TECH BUT THIS PRODUCT FROM ONE PLUS IS NOT ADVISABLE."
49,2,DO NOT BUY!,"works good with phone, always has bad distorted audio when connected to laptop or PC when contacted costumer care all they say is we cannot help it as it is only designed for mobile even when they havent mentioned it anywhere but says ""works with all the devices"" so even if it is not gonna work with other mobile other than oneplus they wont help even if the product is under warranty."
50,1,Pathetic experience with oneplus,Its stop functioning after 2 months of use that to again very infrequent usage. On top of that one plus service center in Pune not allowing more than 50 cases per day. I noticed a long queue outside of oneplus service center. This itself indicates poor product quality check for one plus.Sound quality is fine.
51,1,Doesn't last a year,"Product is average to good. Not the best.Battery life is superb. Call quality not so good. Other person can hear all the noises around, even what's far away on the streets. Audio quality is just okay. Fragile product though. I've bought 2 of these in 17-18 months. So clearly doesn't last for a year. Bluetooth pairing with OnePlus devices is fast!"
52,1,Disappointing transaction.,"Unfortunately I was supplied defective pieces in the original supply & the replacement & therefore cannot comment. I believe the brand is good but the supplier didn't have good intentions. I was perhaps supplied returns, leftover defective pieces. Just imagine that too from Appario Retail."
53,1,Product was diffective,"The item i received was working for 2-3 hrs and later the notification LED itslf was not blinking but when trying to charge, it was glowing. Anyway later the product was not functioning even i press and hold the power button for more than 20 seconds.While it was working, the following points are what I felt..Initially I was using Sennheiser CX 275s and the base & treble was equally very good.. the sound quality was pretty good and whenever needed the base was there.But in this earphones i felt like the base was more dominant regardless of what ever type of instrument used in the song..I felt the same with BOAT Rockers 255F also.."
54,4,Good quality sound with minor quirks,"Good sound quality and nice build quality.I really hoped it has button to switch between multiple devices which was there in normal edition which was discontinued.It's a bit annoying to manually disconnect from one device and connect from another again and again.Also, little bit sound leakage problem is there when used on high volume."
55,5,Best than most earbuds in the market.,"Real experience customer review- very Good in every aspect. Be it sound quality, durablity, mic voice quality on the other end, bass, battery is really good charge once and forget the whole day. By now i brought three of them. First got misplaced after 9 months of usage, so brought another one and two days later brought another for my brother. Its a really must have Bluetooth neckband as i have used three or four earbuds also prior this but after having its experience i am now sticking to it only.  Very light weight and very comfortable in the ears. Never gets out of the ears while running which was a great problem with the previously used earbuds. Completely Sweatproof. Connectivity is really good never gets disconnected and connect very quickly. Latency while playing BGMI is also minimal (really hard to notice). PERFECTION"
56,5,Very long lasting battery,I was bit hesitant on reading some of the reviews but have used other OnePlus products before so took the risk. Connects very quickly to mobile or laptop. Call quality is good. Audio and videos are played nicely.Intermittently disconnected from device (negative reviews):I read this for many users and was worried but this seems to be a nice feature provided that when in not use you can hang both earbuds around neck connected at the end. This disconnects earphones from device but puts earphones in hibernate. I quite liked this feature as this saves battery when you do not want to use earphones. So thumbs up from meDevices I use with:Mobile - Redmi Note 7Laptop - Lenovo Thinkpad
57,5,Great Premium Product,Pros1. Great sound effects2. Bass is great3. Bluetooth range is awesome4. Charging in 10 - 20mins lasts for 45hrsCons1. Didn't know that the device will not work when both the earpieces are attatched together(must mention that somewhere in the box)2. Did not come as a complementary with my Oneplus 8T device
58,5,Value for Money,"Best part of this product is , it gets charged upto 90% in really 10 min as they mentioned in product description which makes it very useful in case of low battery and you don't need to wait till hours to get it charged up again.And it is very flexible at neck side so there are very less possibilities to get it damaged because of rough use.Overall, Value for Money and go for such product which gives you such quality and durability"
59,1,Just like any other bluetooth product,"I am writing this review after using this product for 2 months.This product has nice sound quality and noise cancellation.But sometimes when i Connect to Laptop, it just shows connected to bluetooth but i cant hear other person while on call. Sound comes from system instead of bluetooth earphone. So i totally remove the device and add it again. It gets automatically disconnect and connect back.While i connect to zoom call on phone, if i disconnect the bluetooth by mistake and if i connect back, I can hear others but others cant hear my voice."
60,1,Waste of money no value for those people,Please don't buy guys it's very cheap headphones they selling are with thebrand names so discusting waste of money..necer buy please and I request you people are suffering to earn money and they want spend for onething to purchase they think so much but wat u people are doing taking advantage of that fear so sad plz be some humanity....y u cheating prolr by seeling low rang headphones to brand namev
61,5,One of the Best in class,"Pros: Very low latency, so it's a good one for gaming like Pubg Cod etc. Very quick charge, you can charge it for 10 min and still use it for the rest of the day or sometimes even more. For those who love to listen to music with boosted up bass, this earphone is perfect for you.Cons:  There are no cons for me as of now ,but I want to mention that if you don't like extra bass , then you might give it a second thought.Rest , it's one of the best I have used till now.Call Quality is great and also provides a good connection from a few distance.I ordered the black but received the blue, but it's fine . I am happy with my purchase"
62,5,Awesome Headphone!,"I wanted headphone for office calls, I tried multiple headphones but their mic quality was not up to the mark and I had to return themI was getting confused with some of the negative reviews for this headphone but finally bought this!I am extremely happy and I am enjoying it so much! I will surely recommend this, build quality, sound quality, mic quality, battery life everything is awesome!"
63,5,A perfect alternative for Boat Rockerz 255. Bass Bass,"A perfect alternative for Boat Rockerz 255. Bass BassLight weight.Main advantage is that when both earphones are stuck to each other it disconnects from phone and saves battery. But when these are separated, they reconnect to the phone within 2 seconds."
64,3,Bad microphone.,"The mic on this phone is one of the worst I‚Äôve seen on a Bluetooth headphone. Though the quality of the voice is adequate however it is probably the worst choice for a phone call or an online meeting. The mic, instead of cancelling noise and focusing on the users voice, cancels the users voice and focuses on the noise. It‚Äôs a horrible experience for the listener on any call. OnePlus should focus on fixing this. It seems to be more of a software issue than hardware issue because otherwise the mic picks up the voice pretty clearly in a completely noise free environment (I mean not even fan noise because it attracts fan noise like anything)."
65,1,Disappointing to have connectivity issues,"It is so disappointing to see that the earphones get automatically disconnected from my phone every 15-20 minutes. And no, I've no problems with my phone because I have been regularly using the OnePlus Bullets Z (normal edition) and a Boat neckband before this. I didn't have these problems with them. It's really irritating and disappointing to see this type of problem from a OnePlus product. I only ordered this Bass Edition one because I was satisfied with how my OnePlus Bullets Z (Normal edition) performed for more than 16 months. I'll have to ask for a replacement of this one because right now, I feel like I've wasted Rs. 2,000."
66,3,Good but not as good as its ratings,"Built quality seems to be good  material feels premium. You can get nice clearity, good for calls, video calls online classes and stuffs like that.But if you are a bass lover and you cant compromise with bass and you can spend little more than this, dont go for these earphones. I have been using wired earphones till now and my sony wired earphones with half of this price gives me great bass, balanced sound.So, if thats your case too, than these pairs may disappoint you otherwise they are good.Conclusion: not bad.  3.5/5"
67,3,This product only good for oneplus mobile users,"This product only good for oneplus mobile users because for other brand mobiles is connect it makes crackling or poping noise its really horrible. Oneplus  need to improve for other brand mobile users ,first time i buy this product crackling sound in right ear peice I think its manufacture problem then i replace it but again same problem is occur i am really disappointEd with oneplus brand..they consider only one plus mobile user...üòê"
68,5,Genuine Review by AKK- Great product,"Hi AllWriting after 1 month usePros-1- Great Design, Faster connectivity2- Fast charging3- Amazing sound quality and call clarity4- Comfortable to use and no fear of losing it as it will be around your neck always üôÇCons/Improvements1- Some more work can be done around Noise cancellationOne plus smartphone users can anytiy go for it. Other brands also works fine with this."
69,1,Poor Connectivity.,"Extremely Dispointed..!!!I have order this OnePlus Z bass addition but it does not coonect to my Android ( RedMi Note 9 Pro Max). I have disturburance, cracking the voice, not audioble from my side.Even i replaced Oneplus Wireless with new one under warrenty but still the new replced earphones also having the same problem of voice disturbance, craking soumd on every call.Even i'm having the Oneplus wireless new Z Bass addition earphones i need too take it off to atten the call."
70,4,Review After 1 week of use.,"*Bought for ‚Çπ2000/-*Using on my Device One Plus 8T.1. Sound Quality is Good, also I have MI neckband Pro (‚Çπ1700), compared to it MI has Active Noise cancellation and ENC but for ‚Çπ2000/- one plus doesn't offer even ENC.2. Plus point is that Pairing Device became quite easy than earlier one. But Switching between devices has been removed.3. Battery backup is below average.....4. Time consuming charging... Even MI neckband pro (‚Çπ1700/-) charges faster and lasts for 4 days other hand one plus for hardly 2 days."
71,1,Worst product at this price range.,I had done the replacement of this product post using for one week. Thanks Amazon for this. But the quality of the product is worst. I thaught this coule be one sort of issue. But the noice cancellation is not working properly. The bluetooth connection breaks every 15-20 mins while running any video or audio and then again reconnects back. This is simply worst ever product. Earlier One plus wireless earphones were better and without any flaws.Stuck up now what to do. No option to return. Only replace. So think before you buy
72,1,Do not buy Warning!!!,"Do not buy if you want to use it for calls, nor you or the person on other side can jear anything, chipping/cracking sound will be there for you. No one can hear clearly.Quick Switch is not fuctional, it takes 30-40 seconds to switchVery bad experience with Oneplus, never gonna trust this brand again.Music quality is goodBattery backup is good."
73,5,My Experience,"Some basic points you should know before purchasing this eaephone :-*Sound Quality :- the sound quality is very good, you can listen every instrumental music and different types of music without any disturbance in noise.*Bass:- when you listen any song with high bass or low bass, you gonna feel it. You can enjoy high quality bass boosted song with this eaephone (almost like you are in other world)*Calling:- the person on the call will hear your very clear voice without any disturbance. But if there is someone talking near to you then there is little bit background noise problem (negligible).* Battery Charging :- As i have 5Watt adopter, it takes almost 1.5 hour to full charge.*battery Backup :- once it is  full charged, It takes more than 15 hours to discharge. You can use it non stop for 1 whole day.I wrote down almost everything i experienced after using this earphone.It is one of the best wireless earphones in this price segment."
74,5,The search is over!,"I had boat wireless earphones earlier and that was nightmare experience for me as i work in an administrative dept in a bank and have to make hundreds of calls everyday, the boat earphones didn't have noise cancellation and the battery life was like i had to charge it everyday but THIS IS A REAL FIND for me.I charge it completely and use it for a week without any worries, sound quality is decent and noise cancellation is Amazing.I dont have any complaints after a use of almost 2 months.A sure shot buy call from me."
75,1,Horrible Earphones - Cracking sound issue,This Earphones is completely a downgrade from the previous version.No Quick Switch Button. That button was very very very useful.Also one more major issue with this Earphones are cracking sound which usually comes when we are on call.
76,1,The bass version straight up sucks!,"I've been a OnePlus user for the past 1.5 years, I wanted another pair of Bluetooth headphones and naturally I went to OnePlus as I've had a great experience up until then, boy was I wrong. The crackling sound is so dominant that it feels like a cheap 99 rs headphone. It's there, in ALL DEVICES, it's a software error. Biggest flop I've ever seen. Don't buy this. Period."
77,1,Bad quality bass.  and crackling sound with macbook pro,"I have used several earphones that are bass heavy, and by far these are the worst bass of them all. and if u ever plan to use them with MacBook pro DONNOT buy these. there is a crackling sound and has been reported by several people in one plus forum. u can search that on google.  better go for sony earphones."
78,3,This product is just avarage.after 5days battery draning 40% fast and sound quality is poor.,"Pros.-1. build quality bahut hi achi h is prize me,light  weightt h good job.  2.fast charge very good.  3. Bluetooth pairing working very well.Cons.-1.after 5days use is headphone ka battery drain  40% bad gya h.  2.sound quality avarage hai.  3. Smart switching hona chahiye tha jada better  hota.Finale verdict- in this prize this product is avarage/good."
79,4,Best except comfortability...,"After so much research here and there, I bought this and yes there is no regret. Sound, battery backup, fast charging, connectivity all are excellent in this price segment. One thing which should be better is the comfort in wearing this for long as my ears started paining after using this for just half an hour. I never felt any pain in using Sennheiser cx 180 for longer period."
80,1,After three months there is cracking sound in voice.,I had bought this after a review from my friend. Guess what this doesnt come out as I was suggested or the quality of product is dropped further. I might be dumb that I bought this even after reading very first review being a straight warning- Dont Buy. I bought neverthless. Now I repent spending 2k on this product when i could have gotten something better in low prices. Looks like One plus is just a shallow brand and stands up to saying of chinese product not lasting for long time. Wow. If I can I'd like to have my money back. But I cant.
81,2,Latency made me do this,"Even if my headset is OP 7t still it's latency is significant.they say that it's latency with OP devices are null. But it's not right atleast in my case. Gaming mode also doesn't help in this particular area.when you watch it ruins the dialogues of every movie and videos becouse of horrible latency. Guys you can have this band on neck if you are okay with laency thing. Sound quality is okay,Bass is good I must say,and design and finishing is best,I mean it can be reffered as OP brand's work. Thanks"
82,4,Must buy,No doubt it is the best option under 2k price range.<-awesome battery backup.<-fastcharging works like wonder.<-Bass is good.<-noise cancellation works fine.<-Observed latency in the Audio that is bit disappointing<-built quality A1<-overall performance is great!
83,5,Words won't be sufficient to appreciate this product,"Previously I used many such products, but there were many problems, if bass was good, then phone calls were not at all good. But this product, bass, noise canceling, phone call voice, everything is just too good"
84,1,"While making phone calls, there are disturbance and echoes. No issue with music.","My device is Poco F1 and when I connected the neckband with my device, while making phone calls there are so many disturbance and echoes through the Bluetooth neckband and while hearing music there is no issues. The sound quality is good and the bass is great.! This issue with the neckband is inconsistent and sometimes the issue gets cleared and when we unpair and reconnect the device, the issue still reappears. I have already applied for a replace and was able to find the same issue with the new replaced piece also."
85,5,Best for min 9 hrs calling,I am not a reqular music listener. I need blutooth headet for calling as i have to be on call max 9 hrs continously. I can say this headset is one of the best in this class. No pain in ears after 9 hrs. Battery is good and i use it continously for 9 hrs and still can go more. Mic is awesome. No one complaint about my voice or any disturbances. Music quality and bass is also good. Only issue i see is mute option is missing on this headset.
86,4,Only one issue the overall sound quality is irrtates,"I have used normal edition of this neck band....were the quality of sound was actually so good...but here oneplus has added little more thing to the bass edition, But which is really affect the overall sound quality.and I can't feel the pleasent bass too.If I use continuously about more than half hour...the sound quality irritates me to take off it..some times in the beginningOther than this everything is so goodBattery is awesomeOverall Built quality is soo good and it worth for what I pay"
87,5,Feature lags in laptop.,Sound quality is very good. Bass quality is also good. Voice that other person hears on opposite side of phone is also superb & clear. Only problem I'm facing is that their is a lag when I connect it to my laptop with wifi or internet access is on. It doesn't work smoothly with internet on in the laptop but with internet off it works fine. Another big issue is that the mic doesn't work with video calling in via laptop. It's very much compatible with phone but the feature lags or doesn't work with laptop properly.
88,4,Nice earphones with some missing feature,"I was expecting a similar experience with this earphone which I got from the old bullet wireless. But somehow it's not the same.1. Quick switch feature is not as easy as compare to the older version.2. Unlike the older version, microphone is present in the neck band itself. I liked the way it was in older version.Apart from above two things, overall nice experience with the earphones."
89,5,Value for money,Value for the money .... Better sound quality than Mi Neck band priced near 1900 ...far better than Boat earphone priced near 1700... working range is decent and better than other two...Only drawback is no noise cancellation...  But overall i am hapoy with the purchase..
90,1,Not working with redmi & few other mobiles,It's not working with my redmi note 9promax  I have taken it to oneplus stores they just rest & give back they tell mobile is nit not good u need use this only with oneplus handset. Service people know about this that this headphones is not compatible with many mobile brands and it is not mentioned any very while ordering it they are & they tell it will not working for calling only use it for watching videos. Very bad response..
91,5,100% Quality neck band,Hi EveryoneToday I purchased this One plus bullet Z series Z bass. I want to just convey to all who are reading reviews before buying product which very good habit that this is very good quality bluetooth neck band. Bass is very good and today I come to know that what is noise separation after listening this. I have two other neck band one for me and other for me daughter which is from Noise. But this is ausom. You can definitely purchase this with blind faith.
92,5,Buy it !!,"Honestly, I thought this earphones being Just 1,999 would be average. I also had watched few reviews where in it was put up against boat rockerz 233. But I'm actually shocked with the sound quality and build quality. And also, I use a OnePlus phone so connectivity is seamless. You can use play/pause/previous/next track/vol up/vol down and also Google assistant on this. The only issue is it doesn't show indication when it's fully charged. I'm happy and you can go for it."
93,5,Excellent product,‡§¨‡•Ä‡§≤‡•ç‡§ï‡•Å‡§≤ ‡§Ü‡§Ç‡§ñ ‡§¨‡§Ç‡§¶ ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡•á‡§≤‡•ã ‡•§‡§¨‡§æ‡§ú‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•á ‡§á‡§§‡§®‡§æ ‡§ï‡§Ç‡§Æ‡•ç‡§´‡§∞‡•ç‡§ü / ‡§®‡§æ‡§à‡§ú ‡§ï‡§®‡•ç‡§∏‡§≤‡•á‡§®‡•ç‡§∏ / ‡§´‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü ‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ó / ‡§¨‡•Ö‡§ü‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§¨‡•Ö‡§ï‡§Ö‡§™ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∏‡•ã‡§ö ‡§∏‡•á ‡§¶‡•Ç‡§∏‡§∞‡§æ ‡§ï‡•ã‡§à ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä ‡•§
94,1,Amplifies Noise around you,"The major con of this product is that it amplifies the noise around you, whether its an air conditioner or noise when you are on road. The person who is on call with you will find it impossible to have a conversation if there is disturbance around you.Moreover, sometimes there is just some repetitive disturbing sound without any outside noise. Wired earphones are much better."
95,5,"Best sound, best customer support from one plus","This is better than any other in this segment...Most important thing is, I used the earphones for around 11months, n then left side speaker stopped working, so I made a complaint on 'one plus care app' n they picked up my device n returned it after 15 days...but as they couldn't repair it so they sent me a complete new earphone...n this kind of customer support was shocking for me...Please guys don't think too much, jst got for it..."
96,5,Great price and worth the money!,"This is a super priced wireless earphones you can get today, pretty decent sound, the bass is a little on the higher side for a small earphones, so if you're used to balanced sounds , you might use these at 50 to 60% volume and that should do the job! I mainly use it for gaming, and it's super convenient and great battery life! Almost 48 hours of battery life!Definitely recommend!"
97,4,Strictly not buy,"Excessive voice distortion during call. I have been using one plus z and this one plus z base edition both but this is pathetic. Got it replaced from one plus store but still same voice distortion during call. Its a manufacturing defect with most of this base edition. Go to a one plus sevice centre n youll find many replacement cases with same problem. My friend also reported same l, got it replaced but still same problem.Strongly not recommended."
98,4,Budget buy for calls and meetings,Excellent product. The noise cancellation is average but worth for this price. The voice gets breaking at random times. I don't know if it is a defect of the product I received or a universal issue. Anyway it is much better than the sony neckband I used before which is priced much higher and cannot be used for calls because of the amplification of outer noise.
99,1,Don't buy it.,I was facing some problem with it as when i try to increase or decrease its volume a very disturbing sound comes from it and annoys you and later after 2-3 days the sound increased and kept coming in between music also. So i reached the service center and there was a huge line outside it only for the earbuds as everyother person was having the same problem with this product.
100,3,Low Battery notification,"I would say this is the best Bluetooth headset for its sound quality and daily use. But the main issue is that, when its battery is low and about to die. It never notifies the user. One wouldn't know how it got switched off as the device does not show any light or voice message signalling Low Battery . Also as this a censor auto on and off, sometimes even when u wear it correctly it is not getting switched on due to censor issue."
101,4,Great but missed the awesomeness,Overall I'm happy but somehow I miss the fineness that a 2k earphone should have. But I guarantee you won't notice it untill you are a heavy user of very good earphones. The sound quality is good and upto the mark.
102,2,Average battery life.,Battery life is not as expected. Earlier version had the best battery life almost same as advertised but not for this one. I have to charge them every day.Also they removed the dedicated quick switch button.And there's so much noise in the background during calls coming from the headset itself.Gets switched off automatically many a times a day while using.
103,2,"They are great, BUT the bass quality of the earphones is very poor.","Thr bass of the earphones is very poor. Ngl the sound quality of the earphones is good but the only thing that sucks about this earphones is there bass, so if you are a fan of songs like hip hop and stuff, this are not the earphones you should buy. Apart from that the battery of this earphones is fabulous. It's true what they said, with 10 mins of charging you can literally use this earphones for atleast 3 hrs maybe even more."
104,1,Utter useless,"The product is worst when it comes to call. There is a high static noise during calls. Useless if you're buying this for call.There is temporary fix, resetting the headphone and pairing it again. However this works only for few hours. After that again there will be huge static noise.‚Çπ2000 is down the drain . Could have bought any other local ones for 500-600.Worst thing , this happens only after the return window is over ."
105,1,NO NOISE CANCELLATION,"PRODUCT CLAIM OF NOISE CANCELLATION... NT THERE. AT THIS PRICE, IF NOISE CANCELLATION IS MISSING... PRODUCT NEEDS 2 B RETURNED, NT REPLACED. PL ARRANGE FOR RETURN & REFUND, WUD LIKE 2 BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT"
106,5,Loved it ..best at this price..,"See I took it for calls and for zoom calls ...I think it's best for all these...I am not into music technicalities..but for listening to song, back ground music... As well Its cool.. for a Sales professional I will definitely recommend it..."
107,3,Cracking Sound,Honestly there is a cracking sound that comes randomly during calls and while listening to music. I'll distrub ur music experience. I replaced that item but the newer one also comes with the same problem. Seriously OnePlus must look over that problem.Other than that Device quality and noice cancellation and battery life are good enough.
108,5,Supendo Fantasticaro Beautifully Manfacutured,Very Beautiful piece of Bluetooth Headphone.One of the best Headphones sturdy and tough battery awesome....sound excellentFit perfect.No second thoughts I bought 2.
109,2,"Not having Quick Switch feature, is a big set back..","I was using the old model, one plus earbuds which has a quick switch feature, which is very handy to switch between the devices. Keeping that in mind I brought this model and now I regret buying this, the feature is not available in this model and now It is hard to switch between my laptop and mobile."
110,1,do not waste your money on this  cheap Material,"There is crackling sound in the background that comes during calls games music anything randomly. During calls, once the crackling starts, it continues. It is known issue with the budsone which got delivered to me @ first had same problem so i went for replacement & yet again same crackling scratchy noise while listening music or watching movies no audio comfort...really disappointed...pathetic buds i ever purchased"
111,2,Retail  is not possible while using Bluetooth..,"This product only good for listening music..Voice cancellation not good..Redail is not possible, only call attending and stop the call..If redail option is their by pressing pause bottom twice it's good.I was used bolt bluetooth ..It has redail option and I used it by pressing stop/pause button twice on bluetooth headphonesHope the one plus company produce this facility soon..."
112,3,Not for PUBG üëé even if u have OnePlus mobile...,"PUBG walo... Mat loo iise... Dur hi raho... Sound ka bohot issue hai... Koi bhi 400/500 ka earphone lelo agar sirf PUBG hi khelna hai to...Not recommend for base user... Sound is just as good as 600 rs of wired earphone, nothing is too special about sound quality.I would recommend Boat rockers 335 over this one blindly & any 400 RS of earphone for PUBG saves money..."
113,5,Wonderful product,"Does the job effectively what it is made for. I was reluctant to use it previously, bought 2 wrong products and then bought these. Excellent help for work from home zoom calls"
114,2,Disappointed,I was more bass from earphone as it was names Z Bass edition..  but you wont get baas not even upto the mark.. very much disappointed with earphones.. especially its OnePlus
115,4,Good Product,"Good purchase,i feel like i have invested my money in right thing.Its a perfect neckband for every purpose and connectivity is also very nice,Thank you Oneplus for such a wonderful product and thanks to amazon also to deliver it so quicky. Go for it.Sound quality is best,bass is best,you may have to change the buds according to the size of your ears and buds of every size is present in the box so.Good product,go for it."
116,1,I am purchase these bullet bluetooth,I am purchase these bullet bluetooth using for only watching YouTube videos and songs and inka phone calls avariki ayna nenu chesina opposite person voice naku vinipisthundi Kani na voice valaki vinipinchadu and inka nenu purchase chesina 10 days ki am facing these problem and I am visited showroom and no response from show room and no service centre and still I have warranty but no use. Any way is there friends tell me
117,1,Device stopped working  just after 25 days,"The device stopped working only after 25 days of working , there is no pick up facility for the faulty device is available from the service centers neither the we have a service center nearby, the company has asked to send the faulty device via courier from our own cost, really disappointed with the brand .I was an old one plus customer ,but would suggest to people to also look for other brand also."
118,5,Super product,"Have been using 365 days, 24x 7 - superb quality and noice cancellation. Best thing - it starts automatically when you seperate both the sides /unmagnet it and shuts when you put them together."
119,1,"PLEASE DONT FALL FOR THE TRAP..Sound,earphone and service quality one plus.","Worst product, even the damages happened because of product quality.. between 1 to 3 months you will start facing problem.. The service quality is worst. They won't help you for anything. I am a one plus customer from past 2 years, and even after that they are failing to give proper service. I am surely gonna change my brand, from phone to every small accessories. Nuisance Brand"
120,1,Worst product from OnePlus,"In one word, you can get headphones like this in Local brand. Audio quality is poor and 0% noise cancellation. Sometimes after connecting device, headphones not working with error device not working properly..... Overall waste product...."
121,1,It looses its connectivity,I have seen this issue in Oneplus 6t.After using 15 to 20 some time it looses connectivity when we see in bluetooth then its connected but audio is not coming in handfree.So to reseolve this issue i have every time dissconnect the handfree and again connect. Also i have purchase this several time but in every handfree i am facing this issue.
122,1,"WORST EXPERIENCE, VOICE BREAKING WHILE CALLING","I purchased the product one week before. Initially it was ok. But after 5 days of use, i noticed voice break and some beep sound while calling. Then i applied for replace. After 5 days i have received  the replaced one and again i tested the call clarity. Unfortunately this item also having the se voice breaking issue. I think, they sended me the same damaged item. I just fed up with this item. Iam applied for the refund and i received the amount yesterday."
123,2,Disappointed,"Disappointed with the purchase! The earpiece is designed pathetically, doesn't fit right!! N if earpiece don't fit then what's the use of having earphones üôÑ"
124,5,Best for calling. Slightly above average for sound quality.,"I would definitely recommend this product if your preference is calls. The battery back up is truly amazing! Lasts an entire day with a single charge.  Don‚Äôt expect too much bass. Doesn‚Äôt have noise cancellation. You will be heard crystal clear on calls. I spend 3 to 4 hours on calls on a daily basis, absolutely no complaints."
125,5,Tinnitus,"I have tinnitus and my ears start ringing like crazy if I use certain earphones. This is great for me, that being said, anyone who likes deep bass might be underwhelmed by it.I wanted to reach out to fellow people who had yo deal with tinnitus that escalates due to bass, this might work for you."
126,1,"i have faced an issue , online calls either voice or video do not work at all.  .","HiiI am facing an issue. I use the oneplus bullets wireless z with my realme 8 5g. i have faced an issue since the beginning, online calls either voice or video (Whatsapp, Totok, Zoom, Messenger) do not work at all.If i have started a video call, it works perfectly, but as soon as i connect the earphones, it displays connectivity issues and just doesn't work."
127,3,Good headphone not better then realme,These are good and lightweight neckbank however the sound quality is nowhere near to realme Bass editon.I have used both so dont believe the fake youtube reviewers.Bass is just ok .
128,5,Nice product,The built quality is excellent. You can get a feel from the plastic itself. Also the sound quality is great and noise noise Cancellation is good.The magnet in the earphones is quite strong and is safe to carry around. Battery life is nice. Overall great product and value for money.
129,1,"Terrible , worst product of one plus ever","Terrible - voice distorts when increasing or decreasing volume .NO DUAL PAIR. I called the oneplus tsore they confirmed that this model dors not have the quick switch unlike it being mentioned here . You have to go bluetooth settings and switch from one device to another.Buy the older version it has higher battery life , quick switch button and better in every way possible."
130,4,Overall good product,Pros- Overall the experience is good.However couple of cons.1. It takes way too much time for a new device to get connected.2. Noise cancellation is partial. Not much effective.3. Battery back up is not up to the mark.
131,4,Good Bluetooth headset,My first experience with a One Plus product and it is very positive. Happy with this purchase. Build quality is better than average. Sound quality is fine. I use it for mainly for calls. Do not expect too much noise cancellation either.
132,2,The ear phone has issues!,The ear phones seems to have good audio quality but it starts to give clicks randomly while u listen to music. Which will not go unless you restart your phone. The calls have disturbances sometimes which is annoying. I exchanged my earphones for new one at service center but the issues persist. My phone is redmi k20
133,1,Not suitable for calls,The sound is good for media playing but for calls it is not the right product because while attending the calls a buzz kind of disturbance sound is encountered all the time by which i have to shift to mobile speaker. The reason of buying this device is to attend the calls which is not satisfied. I want amazon to return back my money or else replace the item with the new one

135,1,Not a good choice for non OnePlus device,"Crackling sound in the background during calls, randomly. And once the crackling starts, it continues. I think it's the issue with the buds, and for that you need to reset the device to get it back, and then again the crackling starts in 3-10 hours.And moreover, there's no quick switch button, no forward and backward buttons too...!!!Highly not recommended..."
136,1,Horrible Choice,No quickswitch button. It's a pain to connect this to my work laptop and mobile.Quality has gone down for Oneplus.Oneplus no more. I should have seen the reviews before buying. I blindly trusted the brand.üòÇ Jokes on me.
137,3,Not a good product. worst quality.,They do not support Quick switch like wireless z version. It's falsely claimed that this support quick switch. I bought this bass edition on review of normal wireless z but these are not good. Battery time is less. I am facing issue of call drop as well. Earphones automatically disconnect while on a call. Searched it on google and this could be manufacturing defect.
138,5,Starting was very impressed after 3 month its comes waste,That I have been used only 3 month and become error not working. Starting was very quit impressive even I thought Oneplus is everything compared with other but not. I was maintained very useful but unfortunately Oneplus heart hurtme because If I'm in home than I can adjust but I'm far of my city very difficult to buy.
139,1,Lasted only a month,"While it was working, I liked the sound quality and the comfort fit that the earphone offered.But unfortunately within a month the product stopped working.It does not power up or charge at all now. A big thumbs down. It was a complete let down from OnePlus."
140,1,Received Defective item,"While on going call opposite person cannot hear voice. Bought an expensive product thinking the quality must be good, but received a defective and poor quality product. Purpose is not solved. Unhappy with the product. Cannot buy or suggest to buy this product."
141,5,Sach a Great Headphone But Bass not like ..,"It's a sach good headphone , specially Battery because when engenged headphones then automatically turn off that a one of the good technology . And Yes if you are Bass lover something went to wrong not like dull just average Bass other wise call and other functions are Too Good ."
142,1,The previous version was much better.,"1. Quick switch between two device doesn't work2. In comparison to its predecessor, the battery doesn't last much.Either buy the non-bass version or check out for something else"
143,1,Lasted only for 2 months. Warranty NOT included,"Right side stopped working after 2 months of daily usage. For such a cheap price I expected that it will last for around 6 months, but it hardly lasted for 40-50 days.OnePlus will not replace / repair this since they provide warranty ONLY for products bought from their website, and not on Amazon. Keep this in mind before purchasing."
144,4,Noise cancellation has to be improved,"Everything is fine, sound clarity, Bass, battery back up is also good, especially the magnetic fields on the back of the bullet type ear piece which plays very good role for long battery life, which cut off from the phone if we stick to each other and immediately connects as.soon as we detatch. One thing I would like to say the noise cancellation is not good."
145,2,Pretty Much an average product.,"I was a Oneplus fan. But this one is an average product, You will get much more quality products with this price range. It doesn‚Äôt have noise cancellation and also poor mic quality, you have to put it over the mouth for clear audio calling."
146,5,Nice product,"Amazing battery backup I think minimum of 17 hours is what have seen in my month of use.Good Bluetooth performance, I would better than other Bluetooth bands that I have used so far.Sounds quality is nice as well"
147,5,Nyc,I bought it for my mother and she is vary happy to using it
148,4,Nice,It is good product. It takes only 8-10 min full charging and use for full day. You can buy. It is also water resistant. Can connect to any mobile.
149,3,Bass isn't that great much inferior than Boat,I was assuming that since it's Bass improvised headset the bass would be good if not the best but it's much inferior than the typical boat headsets.. if u r specific about bass then it isn't the great choice. But battery back up is as promised and noise cancellation is perfect.
150,4,Good to buy,"Surprised with it's built quality and battery life.Only one issue, the buds doesn't fit correctly in ears,take time to get used to it."
151,2,Not so clear output with AAC Codec,"Bass is just overpowered. I had other headphone with aptX HD, LDAC cosec which has much more clear sound output. This earphone is just using AAC that too preet bad."
152,1,Noise cancellation worst.,The opposite persons can not hear us due to worst noise cancellation...don't go with it ..too much disturbance while call on driving...otherwise normal purpose it's fine
153,1,Worst,"This is the my  second time to returning this Bluetooth because , having mic issue in this Bluetooth, very worst quality ..The person in front of me , he cannot hear my voice  clearly .....i am a big fan of one plus, i used one plus bullets wireless whis was 3999rs which was superb quality but this one is worst."
154,1,DONT BUY THIS !!!!! dual compatibility not there no quick switch,bad ONE PLUS HAS DEGRADED THEIR PRODUCT IN SUCH A BAD AND DIASASTEROUS MANNERdual compatibility not there no quick switchVOICE CLARITY POOR AND COMPLEX ISSUESDO NOT GO FOR THIS ANY OTHER COMPANIES ARE  FAR FAR BETTER
155,4,Edited review... negetive to positive,After replacing my product is working fine. I didn't find any mejor issue after replacing. Given 4 star because of the overall experience is not so good as i think. But I'm satisfie now.
156,1,CANNOT USE WITH TWO DEVICES.,Please don't buy this if want to use this in two devices simultaneously.  You may not expect that almost all the other neck bands can use with two devices.  But this thing can use only in one device only. Even the switching option given in the previous model is not given in this and it is not clearlymentioned.
157,5,"Superb, Amazing, Lightweight and Long-lasting performer.",Amazing bluetooth headphones with very good bass effect and quick charging batteries.Will reccomend for all rough and tough users.Only the cons I observed is the short length of wire. OnePlus Bullet blows the guns...
158,4,Bettery life is less,"Battery life is very less 3,,4 hours only .. i have one plus buds and i charge them after 3 days . With this nack band i have to charge every day"
159,5,"Overall good,","Battery backup is good, pairs very quick with OP mobiles( Not used with other mobile so can't say about that). Sound quality is also good. After 3 months of uses no issues. Bought it based on real reviews...not online reviews. Don't regret the decision."
160,3,Compared,"When compared to the previous model, this is a bit low inbuilt quality and also as the mic piece is adjoined with the main part, it would be difficult if you are using while RIDING or travelling in a public transport; as the person in the other end won‚Äôt be able to hear you properly."
161,2,Not better as compare to Oneplus normal edition.,"It creates extra background sound. Which personally irritates me a lot.Noise cancellation is better than its normal edition.If this types of background irritating sound is called Bass, I don't like ""Bass"".Go for its normal edition if you like balanced sound and quality based sound.Normal edition has also a better battery life."
162,1,Average,The only thing good about this headphone is it's battery life.The without bass edition is way better than this. Don't know why the company discontinued that.
163,1,hear it was in is also not nice not good so my request is to you please carry it  .,The product that I have purchased for your site .I think that it will good in Quality but it was not good the sound that I want to hear it was in low quality and the charging is also not nice not good so my request is to you please carry it from my home as soon as it possible and refund my money so I can buy another product .It my request to you.
164,1,Worst headphones ever,"Unfortunately, I didn't do enough research, but if you are reading this - Stay away from these headphones if you want to use it to take calls. Barely 2 weeks and people can hear static when I speak.The only good feature is the magnetic autoconnect but you can find the same feature in a cheaper headphones."
165,4,Worth every penny,Pros:1. Packaging.2. Bass & Sound.3. Light weight.4. Comfortable while using in ears.5. Noise cancellation.6. Using one plus Dash charger battery got charged 100% from 20% in 25 minutes.
166,5,Excellent,Amazing sound qualityLong battery lifeAutomatically connect & disconnectPremium qualityWorth for every penny
167,1,Too much cost for waste one,I ordered this after so many of positive reviews but with in seven days one ear bud is not working. Highly disappointed. Wastr product
168,1,Not served my purpose after spending INR 2K,I bought this for online meetings and eas working fine but after 2 months people at the other end complaints that voice is not clear while using this earphone but when I remove this earphone then they receive a good quality voice. Not served my purpose after spending Rs. 2k on it.
169,5,Best of the best,"- best design,- great clarity of sound & awesome bassDon‚Äôt compromise by buying cheaper headsets. This is the iconic product for Bluetooth headsets."
170,5,Best in class,I use it primarily for office calls on laptop. Audio quality to me and other party is fantastic. WhatsApp call quality is also great. Go for it.
171,1,Yes It produces crackling sound. Don't blindly listen to YouTubers!,This headphones produces cracking sound and it feels very cheap. I'm using honor phone and facing this with this brand new earphones from day one. Don't blindly go with YouTube reviews. How's that sound? - It is similar sound as if any wired headphones connector moves in middle of songs. Cracking!
172,5,Bass is good,Earphones are excellent. I'm charging once in two days.. even with heavy use. And charging it is easier than a charging a mobile.
173,1,Not as expected,There is a weird distortion sound between calls because of which i have to disconnect the devcie again and again to reconnect when ever it happens .
174,1,Cost is premium but service is not.,Mic stopped working after 10 days. Service provided by the oneplus care is really frustrating. They held the device over a month. I still not receive the device from service center. Hope they make it work well.My suggestion is not to buy this instead you go for boat or samsung level1 etc.
175,1,Don't buy for iPhone,It don't work properly on AAC codec but work fine on SBC codecDon't buy if you are iphone user because you can't change bluetooth codec in ios it doesnt sound clear in ios a cracking sound is continuously heard.I replaced the earphones twice but it has same problemThe earlier version was perfectly working on iosVery disappointed by oneplus.
176,4,Good but not Great,"The sound quality is Ok, the extra bass that they promise, seemed like they just increased the volume of everything which kind of compromised with the sound quality at higher volumes.Performance, connectivity and portability are all good.For Sound quality just because it had a zz sound at higher volumes i would give it 3/5"
177,1,No Quick Switch option,OnePlus has cheated by declaring Quick switch option. Actually it doesn't have. Older version of Bullets had it. No return Option as well to force customer to keep this waste item.My recommendation to everyone is don't buy this. Search for a better one.
178,1,You are being trapped. please note there is no return policy.,"Guys, please check policy before buying. They are trapping customers by selling bad quality product.  The product is ever worst than 599 headphone PTron which I brought.Please keep away from oneplus brand. I should have noticed no return policy, because means theya are not confident of their product"

180,5,Never Sleep,"The beauty is that once this is paired & connected, it can resume connection as soon as you put the ear speakers into your ears."
181,2,ProblemsPlus,Connection drops every few minutes. The problem gets worse as days go by. I have a piece which is less than a couple of months old. It is paired to an OnePlus 7 pro. I can't even watch a 90 minutes movie without the audio dropping some 10 times in between. Oneplus is not what it used to be.
182,4,Not perfect.,"I like the band, but it is not 100% comfort, the battery backup was great. 10minutes charging on 30w charger get 12 hours battery life in half leval volume."
183,2,Nothing is important.only the wastage of money....,Clearly suggests to anyone that don't purchage one plus because it's only the wastage of money...bass quality is not good....
184,1,Call issue in OnePlus 7 pro,Good company like OnePlus haven't done anything about this problem is just unacceptable. Whenever you call somebody there is noise in both caller and receiver's end. I don't know if this problem is only with OnePlus 7 pro or with any other devices. I hope this issue will be resolved ASAP.
185,1,Not satisfied,Every time i answer call from my iphone i need to connect again to speak through it..it also happens that it automatically gets disconnected on call..i dont know about android but this is happening with my i phone..i tried with another iphone it is still getting disconnected..kindly take back this product
186,1,Worst model,This new model is completely garbage. Audio keeps on disconnecting while video goes on. I thought mine was defective and replaced but new one also had same issue. Don't buy. Also all good reviews and stars are for the old model. Amazon just included them in this new one. -5 star from me.
187,5,Wonderful Product,"Battery life commendable, sound quality and noise cancellation are amazing. Resistance to sweat and water is another plus."
188,5,Handy and easy to use,I have been struggling with earphones for a while. Finally got these a while back. The battery life is pretty good. Once I am done using I can just attach it with magnet and its turned off. It connects to the device immediately when I detach it. The sound is really good and the mic is pretty good too. Loved it.
189,5,Awesome Sound Quality,Have been looking for good bluetooth headphones for music and this serves the purpose. Its sleek and good features. Can be used for Voice call  as well as the mic is really good
190,1,Item is defected and not working now,Initially when I charged the earphone it get turned on and was working but day by day it was getting defected and now it is not turning on even after charging. It is thw first time I got a defective item from amazon which was not expected. I want to replace my item. @amazon kindly do the needful. This is not expected at all.
191,5,Best Quality product,"I have been using different products in search of quality then I came across this awesome shtt.. It provides you best bass,clear audio, epic surround effect, and virtualization.... No one can compete this.... And my it got stretched once and then one side was gone... Then Onplus warrenty just gave me a new one"
192,1,Stopped working in a few days,"I missed the return window on this item. But right now, it's neither getting charged, not working. There's a weird rain noise continuously coming out of the buds even though it's not connected to any device."
193,5,Buy it and Feel it.,This is a absolutely wonderful product. We the mid range customer have not had the guts to buy a headphone of  Rs 25000/ . This has fullfill the taste of hearing good sound. Believe me its good and worth buying. Will review it after using of 1 or 2 months. I think it will stands tall.
194,3,Interfere 5 secs mute in every 2mins,"Bass quality, sound quality, noise cancellation everything is good. 5 seconds muted on every songs while am hearing in every minute. I can't use with live events. I thought this bug in YouTube. Later i analyse this bug in headphones after using amazon prime, YouTube and other apps. Pls let me know, how can i solve this bug?"
195,1,About noise cancelation,The product is good but not worth for 2k..Noise cancelation is not working in this earphone.  100rs earphone is better than this when it comes to noise cancellation...While calling the voice is not coming in crystal clarity.. exactly it worth for 700rs that's it other 1300rs is for oneplus brand not for earphone
196,1,Very bad quality,"There is crackling sound in the background that comes during calls games music anything randomly. During calls, once the crackling starts, it continues."
197,1,Waste of Money. Discharges even on standby. Have to keep charging often,"Regret buying, as it discharges even on standby. Have to keep charging often. Not useful for office/business use. No great music quality."
198,5,Excellent product oneplus bullets wireless z bass edition bold black,"It's really a very good product from Amazon for both mobile and laptop good for calls mics are excellent and for music it's awesome. In a single charge it will go a day in normal use.Sound quality is very good, noise cancellation is good and bass quality is bestüòò."
199,5,"Superb product, must buy","One of the best product. I love using it, good for music, online zoom meeting and regular voice calls. Light weight and quick connectivity, buy this product without any hesitation."
200,1,Hearing and unwanted noise while hearing songs or watching videos,I am hearing an noise while hearing songs or watching videos i replaced and got refunded for 4 times even i am using iPhone 11 and also i checked with other smartphones I don‚Äôt know where the problem is
201,4,Worth for money,"Good product. Very good sound quality.I checked with 2 divice, sound vary in both device at same valume.. i quite surprised.(Used devices - Redmi note 5 pro & Samsung M51 )"
202,1,Worst and disappointing,It is completely not expected from Oneplus. I have been using one plus from 5 yrs back and upgrading my phone on yearly basis. This one I feel so cheated from So cAlled one plus brand no quick switch option to switch between mobile and laptop. Worst one do not buy this
203,5,"Superb Build Quality, Awesome Bass",Pros1. Superb Build Quality. Sturdy Design.2. Awesome Bass.3. Not missing Quick Switch Feature from Old OP.4. Best Call Quality so far. Noise cancelling is not selling point for this earphones.ConsNothing as Such. Just go for it. I bought this with 2K.
204,5,One plus headset,Perfect fit to ear and sound also good. On off control in magnetic earpiece is plus for this headphone. Quality also good. Deliverd within 2 days thats great.
205,4,Good product,I was not sure about  the product after reading few negative reviews here but decided to give it a shot and I am happy with this.
206,1,Not good for calling,Major cons is while you talk with someone you get cracking sound.. it is very annoying and otherbend user get broken vpice from you. Very bad product to be precise. At first i thought that this is manufacturing problem so i replaced it but in new product same problem persist so i am returning the item.
207,1,Worst service oneplus..,The headphone did not work within two months of purchase. I'm used this headphones two months only.. I booked a complaint on OnePlus care.. they get it back to service center 14 days before.. still there is no information about my headphones.. really worst service oneplus.. don't buy this.. my total money is waste..
208,1,In one plus sound worst-background resound coming,Sound quality not good compared to oppo.My opinion oppo good.In oneplus back side resound coming.That is the draback.This is my opinion only.2000 waste.. Take a good decision.My opinion is in sound quality sony and oppo are best.
209,3,Not so bad !!,Backup is good. Sound quality is not bad. As per my requirement I need some more clear / clean sound. Bass is good not to say Z Bass. Its like ordinary neck bands which we get in below / near about 1000 rupees. I am disappointed after buing this product. Please go with Sony or other branded neckbands.
210,5,Excellent bluetooth Neck band,"I am a music lover,as per my opinion this is Awesome Bluetooth,Sound Quality,bass, battery  backup all things are Superb"
211,1,Connection problems,"Whenever I pause the music/video, it‚Äôs keep on disconnecting and connecting. Most of the times when I play the music again after a gap, it will be in disconnected state. Very irritating."
212,3,Battery is not good,Battery backup is not good i am using approx 3-4 hour daily and 100 to 0% take 3 days so approx 100 to 0 took 10-12 hours
213,5,Worth for 2k,After 1 week of usageWorth to buy for 2k.1. Sound quality (bass)2. Comfortable while using3. Easy to access4. Charging for 10minutes you can watch one movi  Oneplus other than smartphone users can buy this headset.
214,5,Masterpiece,"Simply Impressed with , product quality , sound quality in one word its a masterpiece,  you cant get better then this in price you pay ."
215,1,The WORST,"Just after a month of receiving these earphones, there was a static buzzing sound when on call. The people on the other end couldn't talk to me cause of the noise which was much more prominent than my voice. It's the worst product that I've ever purchased from Amazon. I normally don't write good/bad reviews but this forced me to"
216,4,Excellent product for middle-class persons nice sound &less price,"Excellent product battery backup too nice automatic on off (tuch boath with magnet) is very fantastic ideaSound quality not too loud nor less but in average, noic ecancellation excellent ,bass quality veery high which is hart of voice, overall very nice products thanks to Amazon"
217,1,Not a good buy,"Crackling sound while hearing songs, and Bluetooth got disconnected often when there is a call, when switching between Bluetooth devices From your mobile it doesn't connect back. Wasted money on this. If someone interested in buying OnePlus bullets z bass edition, don't do it. Go for realme buds wireless Neo 2"
218,1,Mic doesn't work,"Mic doesn't work. Tried it with multiple devices, still no luck. Apparently a lot of people are facing the same issue, still OnePlus has not official guide to fix it. No quick switch button. And the way in which they say we can switch between devices doesn't work 90% of the time."
219,4,Good,The product is with a good finishing and call quality is awesome...  Very good compatible with one plus 9 pro.. have a long bluetoothe range
220,1,One plus wireless bluetooth,"I was wondering when it failed to connect with Phone, it's not working after 10 days. I don't know what is the use of company product that we use  it's totally waste of money Rs/1799.i was really disappointed with the product .I was trying to return but return window is closed .I don't know what to do now."
221,2,Decent - not good,Sound quality and bass quality is good. Battery life is limited.. at a stretch works for not more than 6 hours. And sometimes it loses connection very easily.If in between a conference call if you get a normal call then this device completely loses connection with the phone
222,1,Worst product ever from OnePlus.,Within a month right earplug stopped working. Now can hear the music from left earplugs only right one stopped working.Worst product ever from OnePlus. As service centers are limited only there is no service center near my hometown. So much disappointment from this product.
223,5,Enjoy quality sound and quick charging,10 minute charge gets me going for a day easily. ~ 6 hrs use. Quality of sound is also good. Slightly expensive but product quality ensures you don't complain about the extra price
224,3,Too much issues...ü§¨,"I heve order many no. Of this product . Everyone is exchanched men two times due to any problem in neckband , like sound , like one earpiece is working , like disconnection problem"
225,3,Not as bass boosted,"Product quality is awesomeBattery has jumping percentage, it will show 60 % and in no time it Will be 20%Bass is ok.Volume is loud"
226,3,Not worthy,Should not be available for other users who does not use OnePlus...sounds pathetic...In calls the other one can't hear my voice properly...Bass is on paper not in the headphones... Battery back-up is good...but what's the point without the sound quality...
227,5,Good Quality Product and Sound,I gifted this one of my friend and it's been almost half a year still it's like a new and no problems faced till now and sounds great with a decent bluetooth range
228,2,Much cheaper when compare to old oneplus z,When we compare to old 1+ z wire is very thin charging time is little more magnet is half stronger than old bass is little bit more than old otherwise quality is very less and the same price 2k dnt know abt durability...truly business
229,1,Broke my trust,Amazon broke my trustAmazon broke my trust Now I do not want to buy anything from here for the second time‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡§æ‡§®‡•á ‡§à‡§Ø‡§∞‡§´‡•ã‡§® ‡§®‡•Ä‡§ï‡§≤‡•á ‡§ò‡§ü‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ï‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ü‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•á‡§Æ‡•à ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡§æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§π‡§ï ‡§π‡•Ç  ‡§´‡•Ä‡§∞ ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§π‡•Å‡§µ‡§æ ‡§¶‡•Å‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ ‡§ï‡•ã‡§à ‡§®‡§à ‡§ö‡•Ä‡§ú ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§≤‡•Å‡§ó‡§æ ‡§ì‡§∞ ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§•‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§¨‡§æ‡§§ ‡§¨‡§§‡§æ‡§ä‡§Ç‡§ó‡§æ‡§¨‡§°‡§æ ‡§¶‡•Å‡§ñ ‡§π‡•Å‡§Ü ‡§π‡•à
230,1,Complain about this company,"Anyone takes Bluetooth(Neck band) from this company(One plus) , first of all I wish to know that if you have a mobile of Mi (Xiaomi) , then do not take it because in the beginning the sound comes right but later unwanted noise (rattle) starts coming and on going to the service center refuse to replace."
231,4,Heads up for the niche sound quality,"Sound quality is good, need to work on noice cancellation and when we want the bass it should sync properly , otherwise it will not give clear sound"
232,3,Battery quality and sound quality is ok,I have used both type of earphones the normal one and the bass variant. The normal earphone was good compare to bass variant. The bass variant earphone price is high battery quality is not upto price and the sound is ok. I have written the review after using 4months of product
233,1,Don't buy at any cost,Genuine review after one month of use . I seriously disappointed with this one plus earphone I bought three timesand returned it three times. Don't waste your money even a single rupee on this earphone is waste of money. There's a crackling sound in the background which never stops.
234,1,Don't buy. Not good for calls,Been a constant fam of OnePlus products but this one dissapoints. There is constant noise and voice is heard robotic on either side during calls from this earphone. Thought maybe defect with particular set but the exchanged one turned out same. These robotic voice issue is constant and too irritating.
235,1,"I got used product, product box was already unboxing.","Right side audio quality is very low. and much noise sound it was not as per expected. bass quality is very poor it's only on title but not in product. sound quality like mono. when you up down volume you can here cracking voice.I got used product, product box was already unboxing."
236,1,Doesn't work properly after 2 months,"After using 2 months I wrote the review quality is good but after two months there is lots of problems comes it's doesn't take charge and also not connected with mobile ,so if you want to buy this doesn't buy Amazon/Flipkart just go directly to shop they given 1 year warranty . It's good Thanku"
237,5,Good Bass quality,Sound quality and base quality is perfect for listening to EDM music although the noise cancellation could have been better. I like the product overall
238,5,The best till date,This definitely is a little expensive as compared to others but the sound and quality is out of the world.Sound quality : 9/10Sturdiness : 9/10
239,1,Got infection in ears,"Not at all satisfied, if you use this continuous for 1 hour than your ears will start paining and lead to infection in ears. Can seller please let me know whether there is manufacturing defect or quality is like this only?"
240,4,OSM experience üëå,"Superb, catches each and every music bit with good Bass. Much balanced and too comfortable.I have used other brands were they mainly go for bass and will miss the melody of musicNice product OnePlus üëç"
241,3,Getting slow down voice while long talk,Overall it's okay but one which is defect in this is if you speak long the sound getting automatically slow downThen again you have to disconnect the call and recall for clear voice
242,1,Stopped working,It's only been a month since I bought this earphone on the great indian sale and it was working just fine until yesterday it suddenly stopped working. I tried charging it and holding buttons continuously and nothing ever worked. This is so bad on oneplus's part and I'm trying to get a replacement.
243,2,Bass Edition is downgrade of previous edition,"No doubt this has best sound quality but the worse things are battery, no codec, no switching button.Hence we better to switch to another brand"
244,5,The best no doubt well done one plus,"Did a lot of research it is really best in this price segment. super comfortable, great audio and most importantly call quality is so well. person on the other will hear your voice loudly and clearly very useful for office people who takes call most of the day"
245,1,Never buy it,Cheap quality.. never buy itSound quality is too poor noise cancellation and bass quality is very cheap
246,2,"Constant static noise from time to time, and automatic disconnection.","There is a static noise that remains for little bit of time, whenever you use it and the bass gets a little high the voice starts to break. Also it sometimes disconnects automatically from time to time, the one plus bullets Z normal edition is much much better than this."
247,1,Battery backup is very bad,"Update after 1 month of use.There is crackling sound in the background that comes during calls games music anything randomly. During calls, once the crackling starts, it continues. It is known issue with the buds, and you need to reset the device to get it back, and then again the crackling starts in 3-10 hours."
248,2,Cracking sound started after a use of month,After using for a month a cracking sound during calls has started ‚Ä¶ there is connectivity issue ‚Ä¶ sound while calls gets cracking after some time of call .
249,1,"there is issue on bluetooth connectivity, you dont know headset set os on / off,","Difficult in blue tooth connecting, if lucky it will connect, or cannot use, after some times, it connect automatically..Not good product, waste for 1999.00 rs..Once connected. it will work..Today 29.09.2021, could not connect, in office, since morning trying.. mental torture."
250,1,Major problem with the Battery.,The battery did not last even for few hours. And within three days it completely stopped working. Had lot of expectations from this product but based on my experience I would say DON'T BUY IT.
251,3,"battery is really good, but cannot rely on it for calls",noise during callsotherwise its a very good product in terms of battery and sound quality
252,5,Very good one,Got a brand new piece (that‚Äôs always my major concern). Glad got it over Amazon than OnePlus as it‚Äôs more convenient. Got a good piece!
253,1,There is no noise cancellation .  Sometimes it will not connect,There is no noise cancellation.sometimes while calling Bluetooth connection will disconnect. We cannot answer what's app call by Bluetooth. If we are in WhatsApp call and we get any call on sim Bluetooth connection will automatically disconnect ( pick up or not)  and need to connect manually.

255,5,Worth,1. Battery backup awsome2. Good quality3. Sound quality supply4. Worth 1999 rupees in this product
256,4,Battery back up lesser than committed by one plus,"Battery back up and charging timing , no fast charging.no 10hrs battery back up once charged,Only 2-3hrs back up."
257,1,The calling feature is disturbed for no reason,I had taken this product months back. And now the voice calling is an issue. There's a cracking voice in the calls which is disturbing. The music can be listened properly. No help from the OEM
258,5,Excellent performance,Far better than other ones I used long lasting battery is a big plus. Bass is ok can be used to make and receive calls in traffic also. Thanks Amazon
259,3,Don't buy unless you have one plus phone,Unless you have one plus phone this is good pair of headphones but sound quality I didn't like (JBL user) it's too much bass and crisp richness and separation is not so good.Also there is no low latency mode in other devices.Battery life best in segment.
260,5,It's a next level neck band.,Everything is good...Sound quality is awesome... super se upper...üòábut must improve noise cancellation portion.And last but not the list bass quality is just fabulous....I'm very happy to use oneplus neckband ....üíñThank you oneplus...üëçüèª
261,4,Older bullets wireless Z was better.,"This lacks the quick switch button that older OnePlus bullets wireless Z had.And beleive ne if you have used the older earphone you will miss that features a lot.Otherwise a great earphone.Great sound quality, great battery life. Very ergonomic."
262,1,Worst product I have ever used. Must to avoid.,"Worst product I have ever used. Within 15 days, issue of disturbing noise during calls was raised. Called customer care and suggested for reset. That doest solve the issue at all. Returned the same and waiting for replacement. So many customers with same issue noticed in service center."
263,2,Do Not Buy,Decent SoundGood BatteryBut Connectivity issues.. Sometimes mic doesn't work.. Since 15 days my Bluetooth mic is not working...Average noise cancellation
264,1,Low bass,"I wonder why some people said, bass is too much. Rather there is no bass at all. Dissappointed."
265,4,Good Product. Need better Noise Cancellation and Battery backup.,"Sound quality is good. Active noise cancellation needs to be better as while on call, lot of surrounding noise and disturbance is captured which interrupts the on going call/meeting.Battery backup needs to be improved. It gets discharged earlier than expected."
266,4,Value for money,"Pros :Sound quality is best.Battery life is Maximum.Bass volume is good, differs while riding a bike.Magnetic turn on and off.Cons :I'm using since 5+ months, if you're new user then your ear starts paining."
267,1,Static noise. Bass not affective.,Static noise. Bass not affective. Too expensive. Apple wired headphones are far better that this one and is in the same price range.
268,1,Just  worth of 200 Rs,"Cheapest sound quality, not soothing to ears. very bad--OnePlus, just hyped brand, they cheat with nice packing--but products experience will not meet expectations."
269,1,Very dispointed ... Don't go with this,Very dispointed will this product... Because while connecting to call ...it's automatically disconnecting and after 10-15 sec later connect. If complaint also there is no proper response from one plus store.please don't buy this product.... buying this equal to put money in dust bin.
270,4,I found it defective,"I have to gift this to my friend so I ordered it before. But when I opened it, it was defective. there are some annoying noises while calling. I wanted refund or replacement but it was too late. 7 days were gone. i want warranty claim in this product which is for 1 year."
271,1,Broken within 10 days,"I ordered these on 4/7/21, and within a week, one of the earpieces no longer functions at all. I had the same pair before these, which lasted close to a year for me. Would not recommend this edition, however."
272,5,Go for it,After a lot of search finally found this and since purchase I haven't had a moment of regret. Highly recommended.
273,3,Best Earphones But There's an issue,"This earphones are best in sount but when I see any video there is a buzzing noise in background. I have tried resetting earphones, removing phone cache, etc. But issue is still there. I hope this is helpful."
274,1,Poor Build Quality,I bought 3 pcs in Jan 2021 Republic Day sale one for me and other 2 for friends. And we all faced same issue that this has broken due to poor Build Quality. Now left side speaker has stopped working.
275,5,Works like makhan,Works like a miracle with oneplus phone. Auto detection on bluetooth phone and superb sound quality. Light wiegh and clear call quality.
276,5,Great Sound quality from a top class brand.,I am a Sony fan. First time I bought non Sony brand and this 1+ bullets are mesmarising with the great sound quality. I really loved it and will recommend for all music lovers.
277,1,Product is not working,I dislike this product..purchased on 10 nov 2021...n on 18 nov 2021 it stopped working..I tried charging..bt it's battery drained..whn I tried to strt it..I take care of products..this is really shocking for me k itni jaldi it stopped working without any physical damage
278,4,Good & value for money.,Good product with this price range. Sound quality & performance is awesome...thanks....üôèüôèüôè
279,1,Worst,First I have ordered OnePlus bullets and received diffective bluetooth and I requested for replacement. In replacement order I have received one bowl instead of bluetooth. Now again I have ordered OnePlus bullets and I received only box without bluetooth ü•∫
280,5,It's for music üé∂üé∂ lovers !!!,I am writing this review after using it 3 months.Battery Backup: Never lasted after using full day.Bass and Sound Quality: If It's fit in your ears then give you sound what to you really want to hear.Design and Comfort: you can wear as long as you want yo use it.
281,1,Defective Sound,Getting crackling sound while making calls. Replaced set also has the same problem. One plus has to check and rectify it.
282,1,Left earphone becoming soundless mic quality degrading after few days,Left earphone volume kept going downNow low volume in left ear.Now in high volume scrating sounds are being producedMic is not so good better only for 3-4 days then call quality keeps degrading.Not returnable.Wasted my moneyNever buying again
283,1,Very poor call quality.,"Very poor call quality.. unable to hear the voice of the caller, clearly and caller also unable to hear from my side.. Facing this problem just after 10 days of delivery.After spending a this much of money, totally,disappointed to buy this product. Don't go for it."
284,5,Good Wirelesss earphone. Good mic quality and sound pretty good.,"So far so good.Good choice under 2k.pro's: sound quality good. comfortable, mic quality no compliments yet. battery good. type-c charger cable, Bluetooth 5 connectivity. build quality good.cons: No issues were noticed."
285,3,No Quick Switch option available. Missing a nice feature :(,"Nice headset that fits well. Sound quality is decent enough for the price, but there was some delay in sound. the battery back up is also good."
286,3,Average Quality product,My earphones stop working in between anytime.They work again only after attaching and removing their magnets.
287,1,Worst product ever,"Doesn‚Äôt switch between 2 devices,Earphones doesn‚Äôt turn on sometimes.Button issues"
288,5,"Awesome Build, Awesome Sound","Bass - Perfect, enogh boom to it, Doesn't destroys other frequencies.Vocals - Crisp.Build - ExcellentComfort - eartips are bit large,even the smallest oneü•≤ and they hurt my ears initially. I started using eartips from my jbl c100si and it feels better nowüòå."
289,5,"Excellent Sound quality, Ease of connectivity and good range of Bluetooth","Excellent Sound quality, Ease of connectivity and good range of Bluetooth. Even at near full volume you can enjoy thumping sound without hurting your ears and the persons around you won't be able to listen even slight of the sound."
290,5,Oneplus wireless z Bluetooth earphones,"Excellent quality, it‚Äôs a replacement of the same item i ordered, Bluetooth connectivity is excellent,Battery life is good, compatible with laptops too"
291,1,Waste of money and time,"Not good, replace two times but the same problem persist. This product have a continuous crackling noise at background while listening to something, moreover during calls it disconnect automatically and leaving call on normal mode.Not a good product."
292,1,Crack sound i feel same problem again after replacement .wire is bend little bit which annoy6 me,Huge disappointed with this product not proper working in my laptop after replacement i think i was looted ...crack sound in laptop when you increase or decrease sound
293,5,One plus nailed it....,Decent bass good sound quality...Calls are also good ...Good job op...keep rock
294,4,Poor buy,"Died in the middle of a call after barely a month of use. Won't switch on now. No damage whatsoever.EDIT: The earphones resumed working after a few attempts of trying. Still, don't like the fact that they had to die on me unexpectedly."
295,2,Battery is not good. Not user friendly.,Its only and only good for voice calls.Battery back up is very bad.There is very less control on the buttons of earphones.My earphone's mic stopped working after 3 weeks of usage. So in this budget this is not good earphones. Try other brands.
296,1,Worst Product ! Don't buy,Worst product !Dont purchase this becoz dual paring is not available in oneplus........In my case return not accepeted.......worst return policy....You can go for boat if you want better quality and dual paring option with minimum cost..
297,5,Awesome product,"OnePlus is ever made  premium quality products and one of them is this neckband. Sound,base and noise is awesome in this ear buds,but when I played game in my mobile then  the more latency in this neckband.This is the weakest point in this neckband."
298,1,One Year Bud got defunct withing one month,"This product is just waste money ... It's sound quality, cancellation is not up to the mark as per expectations from a such a brand. Now one ear bud got defunct ....Plz be away from this fake product"
299,3,Fed up with the outside noise,"Sound qulity, connectivity and Battery back is good only. But we can't use this while travelling. No noise cancellation at all. Catches all out side noises.  If you want to check the noise cancellation do a voice clip in whatsapp. Its horrible"
300,1,Cheap product,"Delivered a cheap product but there is no fault of ""Amazon"" because it is only a platform where services makes easier.for these kind of bed product ""Appario retail private limited"" company is responsible. If there were ""0"" rating, i would like to give the same this seller"
301,5,Worth the money!!!,Battery life: GoodStyle : MediumBluetooth settings : ExcellentSound effects: PerfectValue for money ? :  Absolutely!!!!!
302,4,Poor Design ..neck strip is  too short for me..,Like the quality but definitely  the old version  was  perfectly  designed.. the mic and buttons were located  perfectly....new one is good but it would be  perfect.. ..i personal  prefer  old versionLove  Oneplus.. but this time i disappointed.. with bass Edition
303,5,No more searching.. just buy,Using it continuouslyGood sound quality .. call quality and battery...Cheap and best ... no issues observed...just buy ... no other headphone matches the quality of these
304,5,It's best when use with one plus handset.,One plus is a good brand as usual. From 2000 to 1800 has been drop so it was a good opportunity for me to buy. Fully satisfied with the product.
305,1,Its not connected to device,The product i till try to connect to the device motorola one fusion plus but till not connected
306,4,Good One but,Good Quality Bluetooth.  Responsive and durable. Only issue I had is the magnet switch which is turning off the Bluetooth when out of your ear while hanging. So need to have it in your ear always even when not in use
307,3,Noice cancellation nothing in this.,No noice cancellation in this product. My original product mic stop working with in one month after complaint to one plus customer care... Company exchanged my product but I recieved after 3-4 weeks
308,4,"Good for calls , meetings . Go for it","Good,music is  descent quality for the money we pay. Good thing is call quality , it is awesome and recepient never complaints on call quality. It's good for the calls and serves the purpose cleanly. Sound is descent not great"
309,5,The best product there is. It connects so fast. It has made my life easier.,The first review that I am posting for any devicePros-1 Great battery life2 Excellent voice quality3 Excellent call quality4 superfast connectivity5 Fast chargingCons:Makes using products of other companies difficult
310,5,Decent neck band,Bought and used it..Decent sound and good bass effect.Worth buying..
311,3,Not easy to handle,1. Its magnet not get auto attached. We have move the sides to each other earbud to make them attached.2. Sound quality is fine. Not superior.3. Wire is little hard and underquality.4. Not expected from oneplus.
312,1,The bass of  hadphone is reduced after one month and sound quality also,I wana thank you to the one plus Brand for making such a Amazing Earphones the bass quality is ultimate when I watch Movie its feel like i am in movie theatre Its cancel the all surrounding noies when you use earphones and sound quality is good and they need to upgrade the battery low compared to normal edition
313,1,"Sound problem, i want to return this product","This product is not good , while speaking some extra sound will be their not able to speak using this product, so i want to return this product"
314,1,It's middle button not working to connect call or stop or music forward etc,Use for connecting call and listning music.but all ihave to control by phone since beginning i hhad to move out of station the day i received so checked now there was no extra ear buds also appears that some defective return was sent to me without refurbishing.
315,5,"The ""All in one"" product. My search for good headset ends here.","If you are into music, this is what you want.If you want battery life, this is what you want.If you don't want to burden your neck, this is what you want."
316,3,Controlling buttons can't identity,"Its good product in all means like packing, battery life and even sound quality, only drawback i experiencing is while attending a call or volume up or down, its not easy to ifentify the specific button without looking into it."
317,5,Best  for calling with good noise cancellation and battery back.,"Best for calling. Good noise cancellation. Automatic turn on and turn off. Good battery back up. Go for itBass is not good, so not good for music, but best for calling"
318,5,excellent in terms of connectivity and voice call,using it from one month ... honestly the product is truly recommendable . in terms of battery life and audio quality call quality noise cancellation it is justified product.
319,4,Not as expected,"Voice=better, butSometimes it automatically cut off from connected device and again I have to connect to connect it.AndNot properly charging,or getting long time to get fully charged.(2hrs).AndEven it get fully  charged it shows red light.Above all after using 5 months"
320,2,Old version was better,Previous version of wireless z was better... Better quality better battery life... With mike so better audio as well. This covers background noice and its difficult to hear actual voice.
321,1,Not worthy,Worst experience with these premium earphones...even not compatible with OnePlus mobile phones...u can't talk on phone with these earphones..some background sound always disturbing u... buttons not working properly in changing the tracks... please don't buy...
322,4,Good,Hurts in the ears after sometime. Overall good
323,4,!!Good Product!! But noise cancellation is poor,Product is good in terms of soundquality and bass if uh are looking for listening music its a best product buy it!!But if uh are someone who is looking for noise cancellation for better call quality its poor dont buy it.
324,4,Battery backups is worst.,"I received today one plus wireless neckband z , I'm very surprised as company commit charge 10 min and you can enjoy music 10 hrs it's totally fake commitment. Battery performance is worst, and other things is very impressive."
325,4,Superb! would recommend to anyone within 2k budget!,"writing this review after a week of usage, headphone is very good, initially faced connectivity issues while attending calls, (switching from bluetooth to earpiece) later it got connected perfectly"
326,1,Worst earphones,"In 15 days of use , in call getting crackling sound. I want to replace this product.kindly give me customer care number or whom to contact for replacement."
327,4,redmi user don't buy this,"this is a really good product, good audio quality, better bass quality, super battery backup, in 10 min its get fully charged but the problem in it for redmi user it is disconnected automatically"
328,5,Good one,Good one. Great battery life. Worth buying. Magnetic system is very useful. Only demerrrit I felt was it will not ring if not in ear. So that we have to keep phone nearly always.
329,5,Balanced sound with Decent Bass,"Truely Value for Money Product... ""Boat"" give you bass, but fade the vocals and treble, but One Plus gives you very clear sound, u can differentiate each instrument... with Decent and Balanced Bass! true music lover will definitely like One Plus"
330,1,Not upto the mark as expected from onePlus,The only drawback is battery life is verg poor and it's somehow waste of money moreover sound quality is good bass is just excellent no issue is pairing and very flexibleAlso Amazon only have to replace the Item not return that's painful
331,3,"Product is Good , but noise cancelation is Very Bad","Product is good. Connectivity also good. Sound and bass nice. But noise cancelations is very bad. Its very difficulty to talk while in driving. Facing Too much disturbence. Normal calling is good.And also Sound up and down buttons also have problem while pressing the +, - buttons"
332,1,Very bad quality Earphones not Connected,I received one plus earphones but I think so there is some technical problem in this. This ear phones automatically disconnected with my Bluetooth and I have to do it manually on off Bluetooth and I have to connect again and again very disappointing.
333,5,Good product,What to inform that the review is posted after using the headphone over an month nice sound quality and bass decent battery backup
334,4,Best Bluetooth headphones for the price,Best bluetooth headphones with better sound. The fast charging feature works like charm. Can be used for almost a day of mixed usage. Another feature was quick switch meaning I can switch between two paired devices by double tapping the pair button.
335,1,Voice is coming from one side only,I've ordered same product two times and both the time got same issue. Voice is coming in e right side only. And not able to download the invoice also bcz of this service centre guys are not entertaining this product.
336,2,Poor sound quality as compared to sony/Sennheiser,Had been using sony earphones for more than 2 years. Sound quality was way better than these. Not suitable for music. Noise cancellation is a sham in these.
337,4,Worth for the money Paid.,I'm using it daily I'm comfortable with it's performance and battery backup.
338,1,Poor sound quality,Sound quality not good. Performance not satisfied. Ofter one day use speaker sounding differently
339,5,Best battery backup ever,Best for travel and home use. Bass is not upto the notch. But you cannot get this battery life in anyother headphoneas. I would use it for one full day(24hrs) with one time full charge(calls and music) and 5hrs with 10-15min fast charge.
340,1,Waste product this.. money waste,Very very waste this item.. because of blutooth connected phone & bullets but bullets for sound.. phone for sound..i purchased 4 months.. still these problem continues..so this is check nd purchase..my version this is waste money product
341,1,Started getting crackling sound,"Started getting crackling sound during call,it has not fixed even after resetting the phone  or headphone.it is a known issue with thjs band,so please donot buy this item,r"
342,1,You can not call using this earphone in public,"Please guys don't go for this in this price basically you will expect a better call communication but in this earphone you will only get torture,do not buy this product very bad, and I'm can't able to return please help me to refund or return this product."
343,5,Good,Product is good but they have not given extra buds in the pack which I received
344,1,Sound quality is not clear,Sound quality is average in oneplus bullets z bass edition. Oppo enco m31 is better in sound quality and having high-resolution sound and LDAC codec. Battery is good in one plus  bullets z bass edition. Don't go for it if u look for sound quality.
345,5,One of the Best Base Edition Bluetooth Wireless Headset by OnePlus,Again I would say Sound quality is best and no one can beat the sound or price in terms quality by OnePlus. This is only the best.
346,4,Worth it,Very Nice Product bought on 2nd Oct writing review after 1month..I am sony fan was using wx series sony bluetooth. Post purchase this enjoying it wort to buy it. My overall review 4rating
347,5,Fabulous Product,Highly recommended everyone to this productJust close eye's and purchase itBass this excellent & Sound quality is too goodLove this product ‚ù§Ô∏è
348,3,"Not durable, poor build quality","Poor quality, left side speaker not working, mic not working. Within 10 month product going  dead jone while I am using with safety. So don't buy this product üò≠, and you can choose realme oppo and other brands at this price segment."
349,5,Call voice garbled.,Had a problem with call voice on both ends.4/5 times the call voice is garbled and disturbed.
350,1,Very desapointed product,While playing Youtube audio background noice disterbenceWhile playing game audio cuting sounds like in milli secconds or like stuck feeling
351,2,Disconnect too often,"Pro:1. Range.2. Price.3. Fidelity.Cons:1. Disconnect too often, like in every 30 min if you're watching a movie. Haven't faced this problem during calls2. Not suitable for gaming. Audio lags."
352,4,One plus,This bluetooth device is most powerful charging and good quality of noise and good quality of bass battery time is good and fast charge and I was buy this product second time
353,5,Fast charging and discharging after 10hr,"I am liking all features of blutooth and one is dislike getting problems while i connect blutooth with my phone, it showing connection with my phone but sounds not getting in blutooth"
354,4,Best in this price,"Very compatible with laptop as well as smartphones . Voice quality is really good , the only this which a bit problem is mic sometimes doesn't give clear voice to the receiver end but that's manageable at this price .Overall it's a great product ."
355,5,Good,"There is no Noise cancellation.. but sound quality is good.. good for music.... Also for gaming... There is some latency in non OnePlus devices... latency is like 1/10...not to muh latency, only when gaming.. no latency in videos..."
356,2,Call quality sound is not good having echo problem,Hear music and watch movies with good quality sound but whenever you call sound echo is bad problem. I have reset phone and earphone many time but there is persistent problem of echo
357,2,Not good product,It gets disconnected the Bluetooth automatically during connection.

361,5,One awesome product,"I did not have any expection, but literally sounded better than my wired shennheiser ones"
362,1,Sound Distortion even after replacing with new One,"I bought this for 1.8k and quality is worse that a substandard 900 headphones. I thought it was jsut one off defective piece but even after the repalcement , the issue persists.Better to buy boat headset instead of this one"
363,5,Wonderful Bluetooth EarPhone,Sound quality is good. Receiving call is easy and voice clarity is good.
364,1,"Dont purchase, i am only 2 months used and outgoing sound stopped","Dont purchase, i am only 2 months used and outgoing sound stopped"
365,5,Earphone quality,Very nice earphone i just love itüòçü•∞ very clear sound quality n nice bass
366,5,Pretty good as in Neckband category.,It's quite good but 'Quick Switch' is not there in it which is the most biggest negative point or you can say because of which I don't like it.Sound cancellation is just kind of myth I can say as it doesn't work that good.
367,1,Worst quality,After a month network connectivity issue started..... Voice calls were distributed.....Nice cancellation isue is tooo much
368,5,Superb product,Superb product for daily use. Call quality (noise cancellation) is very well maintained. Battery backup is also descent. You cam enjoy music and videos with great sound. Bass quality is medium.
369,1,No quick switch and inconsistent with other devices,It was working fine with my one plus mobile but when I switched to my laptop the audio was not even clear and after I reset it and directly pair it to laptop it worked nicely for 5-6 min but then same issue with a lot of noise.
370,4,"Its very good for the ""bass"" kind of songs","It would have been better if the volume buttons were seperate.. like the non bass edition.. It's only required if you are much of a ""bass kind of songs"" or else the non bass edition is better for wfh or other works"
371,4,Switching bwtween 2 connected device not ablw to find,In my previous one plus BT there was a quick switch button from where both the connected device can be used. Same was mentioned in this also but don't know how to switch & from which button. Of possible plz guide..
372,4,Good Quality headphones,Liked the build quality & ease of use.Missing dedicated button for switching between devices.
373,4,Nice earphone but,but there's no 2 device switching option for non one plus devices.
374,5,Belt Quality- Excellent,Almost ok but charging port don't cover Pls cover the charging port .Thank you.
375,1,within 2 month -Poor Quality speaker and Voice quality,The headphone performance is good but Within 2 months the headphones sound quality decreased and While you speak there is irritantinf disturbance. I will not recommend people to buy. Poor speaker quality
376,5,Great product.,Good quality. But I am not sure if it is water proof that can be used during rain because charging point is open for water to affect. And mic did not work on falling in water. As usual Rice bag helped :)
377,1,connect issues and on/off issues,having hard time pairing with device it does not get on even after multiple tries does not get connected yo the devices and no lights work to see whats going on with the headset m sure this is a fake one
378,3,Not Satisfied,Its not even working with OnePlus 9R for Gaming while playing PUBG mostly my mic is not working my teammates are not able to hear me..  other than gaming it's working good..üëç
379,1,Worst quality with noise fillers.,"Poor headset. Not a clean output, has noise fillers for even small beats. Could hear noise when there is no sound as well. I asked for replacement, even the replaced one has the same issue. Don't buy this product."
380,4,Feedback,Excellent.. it should have more power backup and 13+mm driver
381,4,Good,Good
382,4,Switching from mobile to laptop is missing,"Light weight value for money. Fast charge , battery backup excellent"
383,4,Decent product,Connectivity can be sometimes a headache..otherwise it's a value for money product
384,5,Perfect earphone,From long time I was looking for a good earphone and finally got the right thing. Happy with the product.
385,1,Not genuine material,"Not genuine material, second copy was available on all online platform, if you want trusted quality then buy on oficial store directly. I'm not satisfied with this product."
386,3,"Good features, less durable","It become faulty after 3 months of use, I took replacement from one plus stores. After 1 year of use it again became faulty. No replacement so I have to buy another pair, bought other brand this time."
387,5,The best headphones ever,"Excellent battery life, charges quickly, and the magnetic disconnection function is my favourite.. sound quality is great"
388,1,Stopped working in 2 months..,I have bought this product 2 months before and it completely stopped working in 2 months.  Initially stopped working one side then completely stopped. It is expensive and there is no quality. very disappointed.
389,5,Overall good product,"First my husband bought boat but it has some connectivity issues, battery life is not good.... So skip to oneplus it's more better than boat"
390,2,Pairing need to improve,Bluetooth connection is very poor. It will take time to connect when we unattach magnetic buds. Some times we have to connect by choosing bluetooth device.Realme buds work better here.
391,3,QUALITY PRODUCT,"I like the quality of the product ... But sometimes sound crackles alot..though i replaced my first neckband for the same crackling issue and got the new one, but sometimes it crackles too still I'm using by reseting it."
392,1,Your products have very quality and not reliable.,I received delivery on 21 june 2021.But yesterday i.e 11/10/2021 this product neither on/off nor connect to blutooth of any device. So I am not satisfied from this OnePlus blutooth
393,4,Only for casual listeners. Not music lovers...,Average sound quality with boom bass. Battery backup is good....this is for who wants bass....but I like balanced audio and quality so my choice under 2000 OPPO M31  best and upto 5000rs no one beat oppo......
394,1,Wrost product,Wrost product by oneplusNot worth itI replace it fisrt i thought only my product was damaged but all bass edition is wrostAlso right wire is long then right one i want my money back
395,5,Awesome,The earphones are truly superb. Worth every penny. Just go for it. As usual Amazon delivery is prompt. I am just loving my earphones
396,5,Good Product,"This is much better than others, If someone is looking in the same price range then it would be a better option to go with the OnePlus Bullet wireless Z bass edition. I like sound quality with bass."
397,5,good to go,"worth buying it if you are a OnePlus user, its giving handsome performance if you're one of the OP usee"
398,3,Not satisfying,I have ordered this item twice and both the time I got defective piece. Very disheartened to receive a product which has such good reviews. I have placed a replacement again hope I get a good product atleast this time.
399,3,Dont get this if you're expecting long lasting earphones,I am so disappointed in this product after using this for 9 months i can tell these earphones only last for 10 months.
400,3,Okay okay for iphone,Sound starts lagging after sometimes when I play and video music or watch any movie on Iphone. Not sure if this is the problem with only iphones or other phones as well.
401,2,Product is  defective,"This product have so many defectsFirst I brought it then it have a mic defect So I replaced the product ,then the new product have a button defect that when  I press the volume button it have a crackling sound ."
402,1,Don't buy this product.. Service also take too much days....,Don't buy this product........ mic problem....
403,3,avg or below avg heaphones.,buy this headphone only for its charging speed.sound quality is avg.frequent disconnects while using it.sometimes pairing issue can be seen when battery is low.

411,1,"Disturbance while talking,not sure if i got original one plus","I have been using the same product earlier,but never faced this problemBut now the new one has connection problem while talkin ,other wise everything is same .Got it changed once but the problem persists."
412,1,"Stay away from this product, not worth the price",There is this crackling voice in between and even after replacement it is not working fine.It really gives headache and of no use if you want to use it for call or meeting purpose..Very costly when compared to cost..
413,1,BATTERY is worst,"after 15 days of the order received the battery is not working properly. Only half an hour on stand by mode. I thought Oneplus was a good brand and opted for this headset, but this is too worst regarding the battery."
414,4,Very good music,Good for music but if ur taking it for calls while travelling u would be a little bit disappointed but it's better that other earphones out there in this range
415,5,Product is outstanding,"All things in this neckband is amazing.You can blindly trust on this, no issue when play bgmi.Don't think too much go and buy this beastOnly thing that I didn't like is delivery boy he was so rude ."
416,3,"Battery is not that good compared to other in range products, overall it's good.",Sounds quality is good but not that good compared to other in range buds however it does feel premium. Battery is not good too. Noise cancellation is fine although other person can hear some sound of the sorrouding.
417,5,Worthy one,After one month usage I write this. It's a best friend for music lovers. For general usage guys notice this I don't know when I charged in last time it's still have 40% strength.Boss is also so cool üòéüëç

420,1,Don't buy this Product,Please I request not to buy this product there is not clear voice and also after one week there is no chance of exchanging the product also and crackling sound is more don't waste your money. Am Highly disappointed.
421,1,Retun time completed no way to exchange this.,When ever I spoke with others some distrub sound came both a end. Now I m using only hearing music only. Retun time completed no way to exchange this.
422,5,"Very good product, worth for money","Very good product, worth for money, i enjoyed a lot with music as well call, very good design for regular use and one request from my side is need to give some rubber or platic for close the charging port"
423,4,Liking it,Currently using I'm using 2 phones samsung M40 and oneplus nord goes perfectly with both of thm. It's a bit more swifter with oneplus nord. Genuinely has great battery life and sound experience.

426,2,Not Recommended For BGMI,"It continuosly disconnecting while playing PUB G. I think Amazon has shipped my a defected product or this is a normal issue while playing pubg. Though I am using oneplus 7T pro, it's sound got mutted after every 5 minutes."
427,4,It's is good for calling with less backgrounds noise.,"I have been using this earphone for a couple of months, bass quality and sound quality, connecting speed is very good but the connecting range is not good. Quickly charge and no need to recharge too early.  Honestly, it's worth buying."
428,5,Excellent buy,One of the best buy I had ..excellent product
429,5,NEVER SETTLE,Just Go And purchase this is All time Best Product..... Never before Never afterIt's NEVER SETTLE

432,3,Static interference in sound,There is a lot of static disturbance while using these bluetooth head phones. Tried a factory reset and re-pairing....no improvement.
433,1,Not worth it. Stopped working in 8 months,Bought these first in August 2020. They stopped working in April 2021. Then exchanged them as it was in guarantee period but the new ones also stopped working in now.  Its a scam and very disappointed in Oneplus!

437,4,Nice earphone,"There is a frequency variation while attending calls and receiver hears buzz noises.Apart from that,the sound quality is great and battery life also good.The packaging was good and received with no damage"
438,5,Excellent earphones but low life span,The earphones are excellent. But the right earbud stopped working without any reason in 6 months. And there is no replacement warranty too. Disappointed that a brand like OnePlus can stop working just like that.
439,2,Amazon delivery is not very trustworthy,The main product is okay but I don't know if  Amazon opens the boxes because I have not received the charing cable or any extra ear tips to fit my size.. This irresponsible behavior is highly inconvenient for me
440,4,Worth for money,"Hii all I'm using these earphones last 10 days these earphones is good for listening üéß for music and as well as classes,coming to charging section awesome,quick charge,very comfortable and finally these earphones for these price segment"

478,1,Not so good....,"Exactly on the 8 th day ,one side of the bullets stopped working , there is no sound frm the right side and I am not able to replace this nor repair this , it was completely a bad experience for me ."
479,4,Produces crackling sound sometimes,The only thing stopping me from giving it a 5 star is the crackling sound it produces sometimes. Other than that it's just awesome like in every aspect.
