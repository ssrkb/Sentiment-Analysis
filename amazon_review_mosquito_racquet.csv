0,3,Intetnals same as chiense once. Battery is not li ion.,"It has the same battery inside which all the chinese mosquito racket have.. I e 4 volt lead acid..So essentially it is the same racket as chinese once but at more than double the price(150 rs vs 350 rs).. Being a lead acid its capacity is less. Also, it won't hold the charge for long and one need to keep it charged, so that 30 days claim on the box is more like in after 30 days battery will be completely dead.. I was very tempted to return it.. But kept it , may be due to laziness. Or may be for giving it a try.. Btw most people don't reliaze that after a year of usage, its the capacitor which goes bad in 90% of the rackets and not actually the battery.. Battay capacity goes down, but with new capacitor it should work like new but with much lesser charge.Edit: aftet using it for quite a good time, now i can say that, its battery has gone down but it still kills well. So mostly it has good capcitor etc. Still though its costly at 450 rs. Approx 300 rs would have been ideal price. But not many good options available in market."
1,1,Defective product,I had to return the product as there was a metal ring trapped and touching the net. As soon as switch is pressed it used to flicker even without mosquitos.
2,1,Dead HIT Anti Mosquito Racquet,"It has not been working since purchase. It is still within the warranty period. The Racquet is registered with the manufacturer within 10 days of purchase. The fact of non-functioning the racquet has also been informed to the manufacturer. They advised getting offsite service free-of-cost and accordingly, they have provided the address of the service centre which is far away from my residence. Due to my old age ailments, I requested them for an alternate arrangement like providing onsite service, etc. Since then, they are totally silent till date."
3,1,Too Bad,Received it with full of scratchI ordered one and then I‚Äôve to get it replaced because that had too many scratches that means the product was usedAnd now when i got it replaced still it is used
4,1,Warranty service is not good,The product came with loose switch for on and off I ignored it being a minor issue after 1month the product stopped working when approached regarding warranty service was alloted taking lot pain searching the service centre the response was poor and service was denied by service centre saying that the company dint intimate regarding the service
5,5,Great!,"The racquet is of great quality and feels durable and of nice material. It has a strong build and does what it is supposed to very effectively. One hit is enough to kill a mosquito. Finally a good company is making mosquito racquets.However, the warranty is only for manufacture defects and not for wear and tear damages to the racquet from normal use. I will update if the racquet dissappoints but out of the box it is working great till now."
6,1,Not durable. Claiming warranty is a pain,"The product worked very well for a month and then stopped working. Once my product stopped working, I used the link that came with the device and as per process, I have to send the racket to one location in Mumbai. The time, energy and money wont justify claiming warranty. I am going to replace this with a cheap unbranded version instead.PS:The LED light is more of a gimmick and offers no assistance with hunting mosquitoes."
7,1,fair,wast of money product it was not working properly and battery was discharge in 2minuts after a charge of 2 h if you not trust try this produte
8,1,Waste money.. water product..,Please don't buy this product..I place this mosquitoe Racquets because for my 2 month old child.. the Racquets battery is not for long time.. I place Racquet charging for one day full.. but it work only for 5 to 10 mins in the midnight the battery  dry out.. I place warranty also they didn't properly respond for that.. they took more than  1 months.. still am not receive the Racquets after the replacement..
9,1,Not worthy,"The dealer sent the first one a fresh piece the battery charge lasted for one week. I thought that I got a better one made in India with reputed brand 'Godrej'. After one week, the battery did not last for even 1 hour. And then stopped working. So, I had to return it for replacement. And the item received was a repaired & refurbished one, That too charge did not last for 3 hours. And finally returned and got refund."
10,1,Must read before you buy!,"This is the most expensive worst mosquito bat I've ever used. I purchased it thinking Godrej is a reputed company and is offering 6 months warranty. Generally I don't expect much from such bats since they're only cost 100-200. But since I bought this one at 499 and that too from Godrej, I really expected a better service.The product stopped working within a week. I had registered on the website within the given period of 7-10 days. I tried contacting team Godrej via call and email but I've received no response. They only say we understand your trouble and will provide resolution asap. After 7-8 calls and emails, I've stopped wasting any more time.I don't know why it has satisfactory reviews, but my experience has been the worst in this segment. Even the cheaper mosquito bats work much better and longer than this while costing less than half of it."
11,5,"A Godrej Product, Perfect customer care.","Let me divide this review to two parts.1. Product - This is a Godrej product. The quality is really nice. Proper grip, good coverage area, a not very useful :)  blue LED to see mosquitoes in the dark. Battery capacity depends on individual usage, but in my case a charge of 3 hrs daily easily helps me hunt mosquitoes for entire night. Overall I am pretty happy with the product.2. Customer care and 6 months warranty - This is where brands like Godrej live up to their legacy. You have to register you bat in Godrej website to avail the 6 months warranty. I have purchased 3 bats and one of them started to spark even without mosquitoes. I raised a warranty claim and I could find my issue listed there. Proves the proper R&D Godrej has put into the product. And I received a new bat as replacement within a week. I couldn't be happier.So for all the buyers, please go ahead a purchase this Godrej HIT bat. I wont claim that it performs better than other bats out there, but regarding customer care no one can beat GODREJ."
12,5,Product is good with no warranty,Better purchase the product with warranty.
13,5,Excellent product! üëç,Excellent product!Super effective.. And what's best is that it comes with a 6 months warranty.A must buy- go for it! Kills mosquitoes with just one touch!
14,3,Good...but not great!,"Writing this review after 2 months of usage.Pros:Safety switch. Useful for those who're having young kidsBuild qualityCons:Blue Light is just a bling factor. Not really useful in dark areas.Battery is not long lastingIf this review was helpful, feel free to click the helpful button so that I'm notified"
15,1,Got this in Rs.200 at https://amzn.to/37fvyK8 with 10% off,"I got this in Rs.200 at https://amzn.to/37fvyK8 with 10% off, but I am regretting buying this product. I thought its a BRAND, but HIT is just a name, nothing more than that. Its worst than those china made rackets. Also their warranty claim process is not working. You just getting SMS but nothing going to happen. Don't buy this ever."
16,5,The best out there,"This is a very very good mosquito racquet. The best without a doubt. My racquet malfunctioned within a few weeks of buying. Godrej replaced it and shipped a new one to me. Great customer support. Till date it's working great.Edit: The first one no longer works so I have bought another one, after more than a year and a half. This is totally acceptable as a life span for the racquet."
17,1,Worst product. Don't fall for brand name & warranty,This product stopped working exactly after 25 days from purchase and even after claiming on website for warranty & multiple emails on warranty there is no response. Worst experience.
18,5,"Effective by both day and night, with a powerhouse of a battery","Bought this brand even though there were cheaper ones because the brand name evoked confidence that I would be able to kill seven at a blow. The bat looks mean in an all black colour with the brand emblazoned across the front. Job wise, it's about as effective as the earlier bat and more depends on the skill of the user. However, its USP, one not mentioned in the brochure, is it's battery life. While the earlier one needed recharging after 2 hours of use, this one is still going strong without a recharge, even after a month, with about 6 hours of use daily. Please not that this has only been used to kill mosquitoes, not flies or other insects."
19,5,Strong Build quality & Easy Warranty Registration!,"It's just way better racquet then any available in the market. And it's branded! The build quality is great, you can just feel it, when you hold it in hand. There is no shaky sound or looses parts making noise. I charged once, and using it for more than a week now. The plug seemed little loose, but still works for fine. Got to be little careful, maybe my socket, it's very old.I really like the quality of box packing. It's just too cool!I used to buy one every two months for 150 at station, this I hope will last long with warranty. The warranty registration is very easy as well, just upload with invoice number & purchase date.Pros:Warranty, Build Quality, Long batteryCons:It's just a blue led light to spot mosquitos in dark, as claimed. It's not exactly a strong torch light."
20,1,Never go with Brand name,"Ordered this through prime, took a while to deliver even though a prime product, the package came damaged, the seal was open, despite I tried to charge and use it instead of returning, kept on charging for about 8hrs, forgot about killing mosquitoes are flies it doesn't even make a small noise, only the blue LED works that's it.But the build quality is good and sturdy, it doesn't look like roadside cheap swatter, don't know the reasons for it's non-workability. Might be the parts being used are of very low quality..Only reason I purchased this was Godrej Hit brand name, even though I read many negative reviews. So never go with the brand name, always refer to the latest reviews."
21,1,"Cheater Godrej,Fake warranty","Worst Product, Godrej Is Cheating customers. This wont lost for more than 3 months, cheap quality doesn't  cost more than Rs 150, I bought this at Rs 350. DONT PURCHASE.I claimed warranty in the month of Feb 2020 finally in May 2020 they agreed to replace it. But, till today i didn't received it they are not responding to the mails, customer service not working. BAN THIS GODREJ FROM AMAZON."
22,5,Value for money...,"Good product, battery charge is retained for a long time, than compared to other products..."
23,5,Premium product that justifies the price,There are cheaper products that do the same job. But Hit racquet is a premium product. It is evident in the material used and the finishing. Width the price of you care for quality.
24,1,May Be Fake,"The product stopped working Mid June... which means it worked for less than 3 months!I followed the online procedure to claim my warranty and ask for a replacement but it has been over 2-3 weeks and no one has come to collect the defective unit. According to their policy, they will replace the defective unit ONLY AFTER collecting it...and that interim period would also be 2 weeks. I have re applied to Claim Warranty and have it replaced but am yet to hear from the company. Hence, I do not think this product or warranty is genuine! It is then cheaper to opt for other units at half the value...and even if they last 3 months each...it would still be worth it!"
25,1,Stopped working in 1 week. DONT BUY,Useless... buy it from other site. Stopped working in 1 week
26,1,Stopped working within 3 days after 1 droplet of water,"While struggling to kill the hidden mosquito, a water droplet touched the bat and it stopped working.Also, found quite a struggle to make the mosquitoes touch the bat and at times while it failed to kill with a single touch.Given the price, how easy it stops working, and the effort to kill mosquitoes, I have decided not but it again.Won't recommend either. There are lot more better solutions available for the kill than these bats."
27,1,Product non functional within 6 months and company not honouring warranty,"Had ordered this product but it became non-functional within warranty period. As required , had registered the product online for warranty. As given on warranty card, had tried calling their toll free number which has no response. Then sent an emails to their customer care with the details - all within the 6 month warranty period. No response whatsoever though I followed their claim process. Cannot imagine a warranty not being honoured by a Manufacturer. Very surprising and that too for a product costing Rs 500!!The reviews by the people whose product has failed only shows the poor customer care of this company. Don‚Äôt get fooled by the brand. The product is worse than a local brand"
28,4,Value for money with a Brand trust of godrej,i bought it in deal of the day 399/-  its worth every single penny if you have used similar bats i must say its durable light weight and have a blue led light in it which is cool.pros:-1.Best according to price and spending so much money on allout and goodnight rifills.2.light weight easy to wave & quick move.3. Powerful bat works with immediate effects.4. they claim it will work for a week on charge thats not true but depends on usages i will say it will last for at least 4 days in 1.5 hours of continues use every day.Cons:- 1.not wired charge so you have to plug the whole bat on plugboard.2.the net is not that huge but sufficient one.Final verdict:-Overall its a good quality  well priced product rather then choosing local products you can have good quality branded product so i would highly recommend this one.Please hit like if my review helped you to make a choice.Thanks.
29,1,Useless Product even worse than the unbraided ones available in market,Except for sturdiness all other things are extremely poor. I bought this about a month back...it worked fine during first 5-6 days only...thereafter it started working randomly...killing sometimes and missing most of the times....at first I thought that the battery might be drained...but even after charging similar behaviour was observed....one day I put this for charging whole night....but still the same response....and now within a month it is totally gone....i suggest the unbranded one available in market which is almost half the price are better than this.....a really poor and useless product by such a good company...
30,5,Instant kill mosquito bat !,"Highly recommended for homes with troubling mosquito and other bitting flies .Features :Instant kill - kills the mosquito Instantly as compared to other street items which just make them unconscious for few minutes but won't die . This racket kills the very next moment .Handy grip - Firm grip like Long tennis batUnique design - With wider area coverage the bat can cover max area in the room to kill the little onesDisco lights - Lights gives more focus on areas undiscovered and helps to kill the mosquitos . The light is helpful at night when there is darkness .Affordable - The price is affordable and it's better not to buy 2-3 times street product  , buy stready product ones which has long life .Battery - Battery life is good and can stretch longer than normal .Efficient - Very efficient in terminating any outdoor flies and keep house safe ."
31,1,Not at all sturdy or fall resistant! Stopped working after it fell down from the kitchen counter!!,"Durability and sturdiness is extremely poor, not even three weeks since I bought this product and it stopped working as soon as it fell down from the kitchen counter top! Previously I had the Hunter brand it functioned well for nearly 4 yrs without any problem! Hence I would say this brand is a waste of money!Also on a different note, it‚Äôs too loud while killing the mosquitoes‚Ä¶ the question is does it really have to zap so many times ans intense to kill them..!!Extremely disappointed about the sturdiness!"
32,4,"It works, can't say about durability","I have already purchased local mosquito zappers from local market. They don't seem to last long. I paid 250/- for local bats in 2016. So the price seems reasonable. Those lasted for 3-4 months only.The spark of Hit zapper seems little weaker. The local bats while new had stronger sparks. Some mosquitoes in new Hit bat burns instead of flashed off which indicate weaker spark. The blue LED seems useless, however you can use it as a torch when you have nothing around. Due to blue colour visibility is poor. But in total darkness blue light attracts mosquitoes so it can be used to kill mosquitoes inside mosquito curtain at night."
33,1,"HIT Anti Mosquito Racquet has battery life or performance issue, very poor only 10 minutes",After charging it around 3-4 hours It work only 10-13 minutes. Battery üîã life or performance is very low and poor. I am regular Amazon product buyer/customer and I'm disappointment with this product. I don't know this issue with my product or all HIT Anti Mosquito Racquet has same issue. I will strongly recommend to DO NOT BUY this product untill company fix battery problem. I don't know WHY THIS PRODUCT LISTED IN AMAZON BEST CHOICE/ RECOMMEND LIST?  Totally money lost
34,2,Not a quality product,Stopped working in less than 2 months.Worked well initially for a month then after a month it's mesh was not getting charged well and thus not killing mosquitoes later while trying to charge it got shot circuited and became useless in less than two months time.Going ahead with buying some other brand.
35,1,Didn't even last 6 months. Warranty is a gimmick,The product was hardly used for a month overall across 6 months and it stopped working.  Local racquets works way longer than this garbage of a brand. Moreover I called hit warranty team to claim warranty ti which they said they would replace. But 6weeks later I understood warranty is a sham. Basically it's a worthless product. Better buy a local mosquito racquet from local store.
36,4,Good strong shock. Blue led Light not very effective,"It works well. If you are on the hunt it is very useful. But if you spot a mosquito it takes some skill to pickup the racquet from where it is and switch it on and then shift the thumb to the other switch to zap without loosing the mosquito. The only useless option in my opinion is the blue LED light, it doesn't seem to let you spot the mosquito as it shines up not in front. Picture attached so you can make your own deduction.Overall it serves it's purpose. Good strong shock. I don't know yet about battery life and durability as it is one week since I have it."
37,4,Surprisingly well built made in india,"The product page says it's made in China. Ordered this as i couldn't find any other decent product (Hunter brand is somewhat close. But their output volt is somewhat less to kill a mosquito). When i received this its package said it's made in india and it is embossed on the racquet alsoComing to the effectiveness, it does it's job. And it's sturdy. After full charge, used for 3 days (close to 2 to 3 hours every day) and the rechargeable battery still has power.Pricey when compared to its Chinese rivals and a li-ion battery could have been better.Please register the product within 10 days of purchasing for warrantyIf you want a sturdy racquet and are particular about made in india product, your search should end hereNote : the first 2 pieces i received had some manufacturing defect. Replaced them with the new ones and the experience was hassle free"
38,1,"Requesting people,  not to buy!","If you have any sort of affection for well being of your fingers, please, absolutely DO NOT buy this product. I bought it thinking at least this is a brand stamped, but alas! I wish I wouldn't have bought this. The racquet is sturdy, well built, kills mosquitoes; but the selector switch is absolutely horrible to the point that anyone will regret buying this. You simply can't move the sliding switch to select on/off modes. It's unbelievably hard. After ruining my nails, I am now using a cloth to try sliding this switch, and yet I am unsuccessful. Now contemplating leaving it as it is although it's a hazard.My ardent request, please DO NOT buy this product."
39,4,Performance of the product is good,"Performance of the product is goodJust because of the reason that this comes from a brand like ""HIT"", I purchased this product and to my knowledge this is working well as of today.Only issue that I observed is, the charging light which appears when you connect to charge the product would never turn to green irrespective of the fact that how many number of hours you keep it for charging and you would never know whether its completely charged or not.You can go ahead and buy this product with no secondary thought.HAPPY BUYING !!!"
40,1,"Worst Product, Not even working for 1 Month, fake claim procedure","After 1 month it stopped working completely. As per instructions i have applied for claim twice as it is under warranty. But every time I got msg that ""Dear Customer, you have successfully initiated a warranty claim on your HIT Anti Mosquito Racquet. Our team will be in touch with you shortly."" And they have not answering calls as well. It's really pathetic, pls do not buy this product."
41,1,Don‚Äôt go for it.,"After two weeks of using the bat it stopped working. And already registered in godrej website for replacement on the day i bought this product. Have called multiple times to godrej customer care but they are not responding to me on call support , when i dropped a mail they reverted that they don‚Äôt enough supply to replace my item as they are out of stock . I wonder how this particular item is available for new customers to buy . @godrej bad service"
42,3,It gets the work done as promised in the description. LED light does not serve any purpose.,"First of all this a product manufactured in China. It has been rebranded by Godrej to be sold in India under their brand. I am not sure why even such a simple product cant be manufactured in India. Hope Godrej takes note of this.The product looks as shown in the picture. From the durability and usability point of view, it is same as any mosquito bat that you get in the market. The plastic with which this bat is made looks glossy and stiff. I feel the charging port is  a bit finicky and you might struggle a bit to get the charging pins in and out of the bat. There is a Blue LED light provided in the bat. This is simply a gimmicky feature and does not really serve any purpose. This LED light is simply useless. Because of the blue light, the visibility is also not great compared to a white light.There is a caution on the bat which reads like this - ""Do not turn the device on while charging. This avoids short circuit and damage to the internal components. While charging, do not touch the outer layer of net for safety"". I am an electronics engineer and I can tell for sure that such things can be taken care at the time of designing the bat. Instead they focused more on providing some useless features which no one uses. I sincerely hope that they come up with better design solutions.In my opinion, you can still get a bat from the general market for Rs.100/- and you will still be able to get the intended work done. There is nothing drastically special about this product except that it is from Godrej and that it gets manufactured in China."
43,5,Works very well,Much better than the ones available at a nearby shop...especially at 350 when others cost min 500. First charge for 3 hrs. That's enough. Register ur product at the website mentioned.
44,5,Amazing product,"I am absolutely in love with this. Due to the rainy weather, the number of mosquitoes had gone up drastically and we needed a good mosquito racquet to even survive. This definitely served the purpose. It's very consistent and the electricity immediately kills the mosquitoes. The battery life is also amazing. I'm not sure what purpose the blue light serves. I think white light would be better but I probably think like this because i'm not used to blue light. Overall, best mosquito racquet. Definitely buy it if you're searching for one. We bought two of them and both of them are working perfectly even after over a month of continued use. MUST BUY."
45,5,The best out there to be very honest .,The best out there to be honestThere is not much of variety and choices to choose from in mosquito swattersBut this one is best out thereIt's made with sturdy ABS plasticBattery life is pretty good and the amount of voltage is really high so that mosquito dies in single touchI've tried killing house flies aswell cause why notIt worked very perfectly there aswell .Go for it if you want something to last long.
46,4,Check before using,The first bat I received was original. It was nice - heavy and exactly as shown in pics. The second one that I got today was fake. It is like a 200 rs bat all plastic . No blue indicators or lights. Poor finishing. Had yashica written upon it though there was a stocker of HIT.I immediately raised my concern to amazon team for the fake product. Returning the fake and hoping that they will send the original HIT racquet this time.The original is as shown in pics in product. So be careful. 5 star rating when I get the desired product.
47,5,Highly recommended!,"Very good product and awesome service.I'm writing this after 4 months of use.It has a long battery life, we use it daily for 30 min and battery still works after a week of use.Do make sure you cahrge it for 3-4 hours at one go.It has bigger mesh than others and therefore kills more mosquitoes.I had issue with one racquet wherein power led light stopped working however racquet itself was working, I calimed warrenty at thier site and my racquet got replaced in 5 days.Highly recommended product!"
48,2,Poor way of selling the product,"Hopefully product should be good , shocking is putting a sticker of very poor quality , I tried my best to clean but the sticker paste is not going. Surprised a brand like HIT  isn't it supposed to check on the basic stuff."
49,5,"At last, a branded one in this product.....","I was impressed by the branded mosquito racket after using many unbranded china makes earlier, though some of them lasted well over a year. The build looks far better than the cheap china makes, which we get for more or less the same price. There is a blue light which can be switched optionally, might attract mosquitoes....which is an added advantage point. Apart from that, warranty and branded product. Effectiveness, tried to kill few, it was fine. Guess, you can trust the name of godrej and go for it. BTW, this is also made in china only. In any case, these rackets stops working if they are dropped on the ground deliberately/accidentally. This one have not tried....so no idea on that side..."
50,3,Seller sent a returned package,"The bat I was sent was a used one. The box seal was broken and was held together with cellotape. After unboxing I understood why the bat must have been returned by the previous customer. Two wires of the net was touching each other for which it was continuously discharging. I poked it with a pointed knife to seperate the wires after which it is working normally. But the bat has scratches here and there, and gum of a removed cellotape which must have sealed the switch when it was new are proof enough I was sent an used product.About the product: It is too heavy for old people to use with their wrists."
51,1,Defective,Product worked well for first 2-3 months. Even after charging for 8 hours I cannot use it for more than 20 min. Now after use of 4 months it is of no use for me. I didn't notice at the time of purchase that it is Chinese product.
52,1,"Stopped working, indicator led lits up but the racket doesn't work.","The racket stopped working after 2 weeks all of a sudden. The blue LED and RED indicator also lits up when button is pressed, however the racket doesn't work and mosquitos just fly past the net. Even a 150 rs racket from local market works better. This racket is way to expensive and is not very different than the rackets available in your local market shops. Don't waste your money, go get it form a local vendor and it will last easily for couple of years."
53,1,Used product delivered,Used product delivered twice . Second time there was a dead mosquito already present . Looks like it‚Äôs a free item with the bat !First one was having a dead battery which never got charged . Best product !!
54,1,The stick tape ruined my product! Horrible product,"Product seems handy and nice, but the stick tape totally ruined the product.  The stick tape was stuck on the main button as a protective covering.  While peeling it off during the first use, it did not come out easily and it corroded the plastic horribly.Anyways, going to use it and wait how it overall functions.Update: Horrible product usage wise.Does not charge up well.  Mosquitoes do not die in the first attempt.  Most strings do not work."
55,2,A hit and miss product.,"Not a good product compared to Rock light that have been using for some time now. A bad purchase I must say, not that effective though sturdy, very unclear when it is efficient enough to kill mosquitoes or small flies. Even after charging for sufficient time say 6-8 hours with off mode, does not give confidence when mosquitoes just bypass the charged barricade fence without short circuiting them."
56,1,Bad quality died in 3 months,Design vise it looks great.. at beginning it was working well.. seems to be a true godrej product.. but steady it started giving less battery backup and one day it stopped completely it's not turning on even after charging it for days.. so it seems to be a trap please don't fall for this. I can't say it's a fake godrej product built quality and all seems to be up to the mark.. but what's the use if it's not doing what it has to..
57,1,Rating is 0,1. Barely a week into use the racket stopped working2. Customer care & warranty service remains unreachable3. There‚Äôs no response from emails sent to customer support for warranty claims4. Repair at local person costs additional 200 bucks. Don‚Äôt fall for this costly product.Just buy a cheaper one for use & throw
58,5,Quality product,"Good built quality. Working fine so far. Product came with extremely well packing.The question is how long it will last, since most of the rackets stops working within 3-4 months without any reason. Also customer support is always poor for such products so how to avail the warranty is another question."
59,1,Product faulty within weeks of usage,"Like others I too went with the brand name of Godrej, and was fooled. The product became faulty within few weeks of usage. Now totally useless. The quality of the material is also substandard. The plastic body looks cheap. Initially for the first few days the bat was good to catch mosquitoes. I don't know how a branded house like Godrej could come up with a sub standard item. Contacted Godrej customer service but of no use."
60,1,"Don't Buy, Stopped working after 6 months. Better buy a roadside cheap one that'll last longer.",The device is charging but not killing mosquitoes anymore. the company too knows it won't last long so they only give you 6 months warranty. I had a road side Racquet which lasted longer and was half the price of this one. Also the batter it comes with is also very cheap. There's no quality control over all.
61,2,Not worth buying,"Been using it for well over a month now. The battery life is substantially better than the previous local brand I had purchased last year.UPDATED after almost 8 months of use -It worked fine during the first season after purchase, so much so that I had rated it 5-star. But after taking it out for use again this season I've found that its battery is not retaining any charge even after remaining plugged in for almost 24 hours. The warranty is only for 6 months, which is over now.I had decided to purchase a good, branded product even if it was more expensive, but the logical thing to do seems to be to purchase a cheaper, unbranded one each year that I don't expect to last more than one season."
62,5,Functioning well,"I have been using it for only two weeks so it is too early to comment on the long-term performance. But I have been satisfied so far. ‚ñ™Ô∏èBattery- I have charged it only once since it arrived.‚ñ™Ô∏èDesign- The make has all the appearance of sturdiness one can expect in this object. I like the design; it can easily rest on its base in any corner without repeatedly falling (unlike my previous racquet which was actually round like a badminton racquet and wouldn‚Äôt stand erect).‚ñ™Ô∏èFunction- It kills mosquitoes and other insects with a loud snap which is reassuring and confirmatory (sounds cruel but that is what I bought it for). It is easy to use (like all racquets).So far, so good. Rest time will tell."
63,5,"Sturdy, Long battery life , very effective mosquito killer","This is the best mosquito racquet one can buy. Long lasting battery life, very effective mosquito trap.I have bought two for my home. First one was bought in 2018 (which is now two years) and the build quality is amazing.This raquet at my home has gone through falls on floor many times and hit with hard surfaces like walls and solid wood edges.But it doesn't dies with time.People go with normal raquets worth 100 or 200 rupees but ultimately they tend to buy them multiple times when the item becomes non-functional after rough usage.It's better to invest in something like this and be assured."
64,5,Sturdy and Good Battery.. (edit: stopped working) > (Update: Got Replacement through warranty),"I charge it once every two days and it works fine, the ""pop"" is very satisfying  to hear.The UV/ Blue light doesn't seem to do anything, mosquitoes don't seem to fall for that gimmick, other than that. the material is strong (which is it's main quality). Dropped it several times and it still functions as new.The earlier reviewers said that the buttons are falling apart, I haven't faced it yet, and even if it does, nothing a ‚Çπ5 feviquick can't fix.Edit: After 2 months, the racquet stopped working..Have raised a warranty claim, will y'all updated.Update: The warranty claim was approved and a brand new racquet was delivered.Thanks Godrej."
65,1,Worst product,This is one of the worst products available in Amazon. Please don‚Äôt buy seeing the brand name HIT/ Godrej as it didn‚Äôt last for even 2 months. It worked fine initially and suddenly it‚Äôs battery stopped draining. After a full charge it started draining completely in 10mins. Then in another couple of days it just stopped charging. Thrown to dustbin. Waste of money and an unwanted plastic garbage.
66,1,Same as the made in China ones! Avoid!,"The first one I got worked for 1 day after which the charging pins got stuck and would not retract inside.I opted for a replacement (why!) and was promptly sent another one which came in a squashed box, scratches, no protector tape on the power button and was DEAD ON ARRIVAL!Please go to the market and buy a cheap local one, at least if it stops working you don't get disappointed.GODREJ/ALL OUT, WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR COMPANY?"
67,1,Within two weeks it is short circuited. I request warranty and replacement,Worked for one week. Within 2nd week it short circuited and not working. During second week it has developed short circuit and sparkling.  I have reported the problem. No response from amazon.in.  I do hereby invoke warranty claim and request you to replace the item.
68,5,Very useful with pesky mosquitoes around,Very good product.Finish is smooth.Mosquitoes get killed in 2-3 sparks. Be sure to trap the mosquito as they tend to escape with a single spark.Very little charging is required as the battery retains the charge for a long time.It is better than exposing yourself to the fumes of anti mosquito sprays and chemical evaporating devices.The racket is effective both inside and outside and a very handy product.
69,1,Defective Unit delieverd,"my Sister had ordered the same bat one year back and it was working fine till now and finally gave up, so i placed a New Order, but a Defective Unit was delivered and looks like it was already used by someone else before sending to me, Very Disappointed"
70,4,So far so good !,"The racket is quite sturdy than any of the Chinese made one. The difference is visible and can be felt. It works quite effectively. The blue light emitted serves dual purpose of visibility in dark as well as attraction of the flys / Mosquitos (though not a very effective idea) it's been over 45 days of use, it's working fine. Will leave an edit in case of trouble. However the 6 months warranty inclusion is a bonus. It is from the Indian stable of Godrej, so you can expect a bit of decent quality for the price."
71,1,Not the best,Used it for less than a month and charger led not showing and does not work properlyIt kills all insects but durability is not adequate for this price. I suggest Hunter bcoz I used it for so many years and it works fine I thought this would replace my Hunter bat but it does not fulfill my wishes as a customer
72,1,Battery does not last for even 20 minutes,"I have registered for the warranty soon after receipt of the item.  When I started using after charging, I found the battery was draining very fast and now it has dropped to less than 10 minutes. My email to  Godrej Customer care has not been responded at all.Nagaraja P S"
73,1,Dont buy..Bad Product Bad Battery Life,"Very Bad product DONT BUY THIS AGAIN and burn ur fingers..bought this by seeing the name Godrej and Amazon.Bought un Feb2021 and got repaired in 4th February(.Problem, BATTERY ISSUES..Getting charged  but not working).Return window was also  closed ..To claim warranty..unable to reach Compnay customer care..After buying products from Amazon past 4 to 5 years.Called Amazon and they simply rejected my request saying return endow was closed...Feel very BAD because of this product...Now really I don't know to whom I should address the issue like this ..My TRUST on AMZON always high...now it made me to think to revise.RgdsKannan -A badly affected customer.."
74,5,Best Mosquito Bat with Warranty - Top Quality and Instant Mosquito Kill,"Top quality mosquito bat in the market. If you are looking for a mosquito bat, then this is the product you need. The bat comes with a nice packaging and you can tell about the quality with first look at the product. The registration process for warranty was also very easy. Sturdy design, instant mosquito kill, great battery life with warranty makes this product the best in the market."
75,5,Blood saver!,"This one's a life saver or should i say blood saver. This is our second purchase since the charging plug of the first one got damaged after a fall. It is sturdy and would it be weird to say that it looks good. The charge stays for around a month (depending on usage). Should ensure that it is not switched on while being plugged in for long periods. It also has a pretty blue light which we sparingly use but just putting it out there. Does what it is supposed to do (zap those mosquitos). Perfect your aim and it takes care of the rest :) So wish there was a permanent solution to mosquitos in our country. For now, this paired up with a mosquito net is helping!Click on the 'Helpful' link below if you found this review helpful! :)"
76,5,"You can read MY views, it should help clear your doubts.","ive been hit with it once by my sister(ofc during a fight, and note that I was hit at full speed) and it still works perfectly.(quite sturd you see).Battery would seem not that good because it only lasts about 6-7hrs ig however you aren't using like a phone, man you merely need to use it any more than 40mins max to max and considering this your racquet would work efficiently for 5-7days, amount of days it would last depends on the usage of per day. but umm, it takes 6-7hrs to be fully charge which some of you may think of as a minus point but hey it's fine, you're getting affordable price, recognised brand and also warranty period.you can go for it, it was the best among the  others that i could find.man no photos, it looks exactly the same as they attached in product detail. oh also, size is less than that of a badminton racket but slightly, just slightly bigger(or taller) than tennis racket. Speaking about size,Its mass(yeah 'mass', science my man science) is okayish. Bought a couple of months ago and still is working.kay, see ya!"
77,5,Not worth  product,"Update: Recieved the replacement now stating delay due to lockddowns definitely worth it!!Update: The bat went off in 6 Months, raised a complaint in waranty, no  one has attended nor replaced.Better to buy bats from local shops which costs half the price and work for atleast 1 yr, opened to see the battery suprised to see a cheaper one which doesnt cost more than  50 .Bat is good, however I feel buttons sliding could be easy one for power on one for lighting. Battery back up too is good"
78,3,Non Standard Product.,"I purchased this product 4 Nos on 20/10/2019. Out of 4 Nos since 1 week 2 nos are not working at all. Battery life is good but it is not looking like heavy duty item and the material (plastic) used is not upto standards of a company like Hit. As far as durability is concerned with in 2 months of time, they are not working. I think you have given me a 6 months guarantee period for this product. Kindly arrange to take back or inform me where to send for exchange or replacement for these 2 nos which are not working at all."
79,2,Mosquito Racket from Hit not so efficient.,"Battery lifeüîã is an issue as after charging for whole it is giving the backup of 15minutes.This review is based on uses around 15days, bought this product on the name of Hit but now where to go for the solution please guide me as the return date expired just two days back."
80,1,Local racquets are better than this.,Battery life after few months dropped significantly and it‚Äôs very poor cause it‚Äôs most important part of the product.Plastic quality is ok and net quality is ok.Product become useless after battery life span end.LED light is totally useless.
81,1,Godrej is cheating people.,"Horrible product and 3rd class aftersales warranty.. I bought 2 rackets trusting Godrej!One is ok but the otherone doesnt charge! We tried contacting the warranty website, it says sending otp and then everything goes blank... Must hv tried 10-12 times... Given up nowWill tell all my friends family and everyone I know to never by Godrej! This is why ppl buy Chinese... Because Indian companies cheat their own ppl."
82,5,A very good racquet. The material quality is indeed different from the ones we've been buying,"First of all..This product also came from China/ PRC. Go to the Godrej website and see the Raquet details. It will tell you that the first Country of Origin is Republic Of China and then India. That should be enough to draw a line in the argument, ""better than Chinese products"". This also came from there. """"CRITICS"""" will be enlightened.The build quality is better. Feels premium holding it. They're giving 6 months' warranty too. You have to go to the Website and register for it.It is costlier, compared to the 200 ones, but they stop working properly after a year..or sometimes within months. If this can last for even 2 years, then it is Rs 500 well spent."
83,5,Heavy duty weapon against Mosquitoes Flies,"This is super weapon against stubborn mosquitoes.Buikd quality is great ,heavy duty sturdy and looks are good.This weapon comes with a night neon light.It instantly turns your enemies in to ashes ,battery life is super.You will see the difference comparing with any other local brands.Mosquitoes flies,spider and small bugs all can be handled well by this beast."
84,1,Deceiving information regarding country of Origin,"I purchased this product twice in past, in last year. I specifically remember the country of origin was mentioned as India that time. I trusted the brand ""Godrej"" which was a mistake. Now when I came back to this product to buy it again for the 3rd time, surprisingly the country of origin is now ""China"". Going forward i will be very sceptical of this so called indian brand."
85,1,Tennis Racket not Mosquito Killer,Lasted 10 days...Buy from your local market or kirana stores. Atleast you get a satisfaction of going there to scold them if a defective product is given to youHit?? Worst than a Chinese product. I guess made by a vendor to whom Chinese outsource there manufacturers!!!
86,5,bang for your buck (‚åê‚ñ†_‚ñ†),"Using it since last year, still works fine.I love its features that now I have reached master level where I am able to smash direct hits even with fast zig zag flying filthy fly. And killing mosquitos has become my favorite evening past-time.God bless whoever invented this product, its hell lot useful üê±‚Äçüë§(‚åê‚ñ†_‚ñ†)"
87,1,HIT anti mosquito racket in mis action from Amazon,The racket stopped working after a few use in one month.Is there a point of purchasing the same when warranty of 6 months is of no purpose . customer service people of Amazon is not helping and customer service call number of Godrej 1800266007 is not responding. It is better to buy such product from mkt at half the rate. I wonder if cloudtailco. of Amazon which is the retail  seller is refusing to honour the warranty.
88,5,"Elegant, Handy & Useful","Sleek & slim design. Black body. Smooth body surface. Very effective in killing mosquitos and other flying insects.  After charging, it can be used for several days, my experience says. I've been using it for about a month. An efficient killer. Mosquitos, flies get electrocuted to death in no time. But it's a Chinese product marketed by Godrej handing down a six month's warranty. The item seems a bit expensive compared to similar products available in the range of  Rs. 165--225/- in the market. The racquet comes in a sturdy packing box. Keep it there when you'll not use it."
89,5,Expensive but Good product. happy with the choice.,"I like the built quality if this product. Tough and thick plastic gives good grip and usability. There is a blue LED provided to attract the mosquitoes. Theoretically it should work because mosquitoes are supposed to be attracted towards blue spectrum of the light, but I didn't see any use of it. Maybe they missed the perfect LED that emits the violate range of light which could attract flies or mosquitoes. Battery backup is good. I had recharged once a week ago, haven't recharged again yet. This is the first racquet I ever saw that comes with a 1-page user manual instructing about proper usage and battery charging. Kudos for that."
90,5,"Strong and sturdy, the one and one choice for mosquito bat",I bought this just before lockdown in Mar'20. My son sometimes bangs it and plays with it. All bat s I have tried using till now has been damaged when my son banged it. This is working perfectly even now. Its 10 months now. Charging and battery life is good and this is perfect for that one or two little mosquitoes that disturb you at night. 5 star!
91,1,No point of having a sturdy & durable racquet if the battery doesn't work,"Within 4 months of using this 'good quality' racquet, the battery hardly holds any charge. No matter how long you charge it, it won't last an hour. The blue light that's a 'feature' in it for some odd reason serves no purpose. This is an absolute garbage of a product. I'd rather buy some other cheap alternative which works atleast for a year which is probably made in China! Don't waste your money on this."
92,5,Mosquitoes here we come!!,"This is really good product. I have zapped several mosquitoes since it‚Äôs arrival. Battery Life is sufficient for two days, if u go on a hunt every evening. If not then it would stay for maybe more than two days. Small blue battery exists to capture those mosquitoes which haunt us at night after the lights have been turned off- Useful feature. I have for a month now. No problems at all. To clean the zapped mosquitoes use a brush! My bat needs cleaning! Sorry for the last image"
93,4,Strudiness not upto the mark!,"It is very good in performance. But mosquitoes are not killed in one shocked. They remain flying as usual. The mosquitoes get stuck within the net. You have to manually throw them out by moving the bat. Sometimes, the mosquitoes don't even come out, and get friedüòÇ with bad smell and smoke.The Bat is very fragile, i mean, the parts are little loose and some sound comes when i move it.The battery life is great, you can use it more than two weeks with 1 full chargeOverall, I would recommend you to buy this but keep it in safe hands, as the net produces shock even if the switch is off. and use it carefully, for it might break if it falls."
94,4,Good and reliable product.,"This one is a sturdy and reliable version of what we get in local shops. Design is good, easy to use and does what it claims. I got 2 pieces of this. One is working just fine while the other one has battery issues. Needs to be recharged quite often. One issue with both the pieces is the plug for charging. It is very loose and rigid. Doesn't go in and come out easily. Rest all is fine."
95,1,"DON'T BUY IT , WASTE OF MONEY","Though quality is bit better than you get at local stores for less than 200‚Çπ , but thinking rationally thinking , is it worth paying 300‚Çπ extra for this ??? Answer is big NOI just preferred this product , thinking it would long laster since there's a warranty but stopped working in 3 months. Guess you can't claim your warranty coz their customer care number doesn't work.STRICTLY GO FOR RACQUET FROM LOCAL STORES WHICH YOU CAN GET FOR LESS THAN 200‚Çπ , IT'S NOT WORTH 500‚Çπ"
96,5,The Best Mosquito Racquet Ever.!!,The racquet is very good quality and also very powerful.It is the most expensive racquet I have ever bought... BUT SURELY THE BEST AND VERY STURDY CONSTRUCTION TOO.I was clearing a whole load of Mosquito's in a corner at the farm.. and I had to keep the button pressed as there were many... and 2 bees were also killed instantly.!!Very happy with the product.
97,4,Gud product but but pricey.,Bit pricey bt atleast it's better than those racquets that are available in local market which stops working after 2 months..I got it in its actual price 499rs.But later I saw its available in less amount in other websites ..but it will never be available below 349rs.Quality is gud..I saw it's from a gud brand hit ..so i ordered it..And its better to buy a costly product than to buy a cheap product again and again..Battery life is gud but it will decrease after long use..but it will definitely work atleast for 1yr or 1.5yr..not like those of local market products which work maximum for 2 mnths...
98,1,Very fr√†gile and delicate.,Writing this review after a month of using this product. The battery life is good however after using it for a month the inside circuit is shaking. Each time I swing it it feels like there is a stone inside that is moving and making noise. Not worth it.
99,5,Very good quality,"I am writing the review after 3 months of usage. Charged it the day it arrived and I am still using it. Although my usage is less, the charge lasted several weeks and still goes on. The spark is pretty strong. The only issue is that something is loose inside the handle. When I make movements to hit the mosquitos, something moves inside."
100,5,BEST RACQUET USED,"i have used more than 5 racquets in the past year and all the racquets stoped working after approximately 2 months then i bought this! This is just a superb product ,the quality so premium compared to all other racquets i have used! i have to say hit really did some good job on this one! there is also light to see in dark and the battery life is amazing plus it has a 6 months warranty, i would say go for this one rather than spending on local razquets every month! money well spent!"
101,1,Warranty claim is a scam,"The warranty thing is an absolute scam!Atleast according to my experience, i tried to register using my invoice number and it says the invoice is already registered. Now when i try to claim warranty using phone and email id, it says its not registered. The racket is good looking and everything but i am absolutely unsure about how its quality is going to be considering the high price tag. My main charm to buy this was Godrej and the warranty but those seemed to not work out at all! Buy only if you're sure about being delicate with the usage!"
102,1,Used defective product sent with scratches and mosquitoes in the net.,"Used defective product sent when I paid full money. Racquet plastic body full of scratches, dead mosquitoes can be seen inside the net and electric shock not functioning. Just packed some used stuff in a new box and sent. I got fooled by 790plus reviews. Wonder how they got such review when they are busy doing such malpractices. Shame on you giving such products to customers when we are paying you the rightful money."
103,1,Bad experience with pick up team of return items,I replaced the item as it was not working. Something is really problematic with Amazon return pick up team. Since my last experience was really bad as the pick up guy did not enter the item in Amazon system after collecting it hence I make a small video of the guy collecting pick up this time. The pick up guy was really rude and he threatened that even if you have video you can not do anything. After repeatedly asking are you from amazon or not he accepted that he is from Amazon
104,5,B E S T! !,It is the best racquet that you can get to kill mosquitoes rather than hittinh shuttle. It's build quality is very nice. First charge takes 15hrs but after that 2-3 hrs daily if used regularly. It's sturdy and doesn't shake while in action. It has a lazer light too  to find and kill the mosquitoes at night.
105,5,"Crackle sound lasts long after recharging, mosquito in control.","It's been over 10 days and return window has closed. So far, the HIT Anti-mosquito Racquet of Godrej is working superb. The crackling sound it makes when mosquitoes come in contact with the wire mess is loud and battery lasts long on every recharge.Got to be careful about the charging pin and the slider though, not that durable as the other part of the racquet, that's my only concern with this racquet for now.Packaging by Amazon was perfect, received Type I - Made in China racquet. Type II is Made in India racquet.Warranty is against manufacturing defects for 6 month from the date of purchase with purchase bill.Within 10 days from purchase, do register your racquet on www.godrejhit.com/racquet to claim warranty benefit.I hope, this racquet lasts long."
106,3,Good but too many lies by godrej,"Looks good but its flashlight is bad I mean really really bad. I can't see any mosquito an it annoyed me too. Btw after 2 day use age battery got low so that means that 30 day battery life is a proper lie and 7 hour charge gives you 1 full day batter backup. But I am happy with that warranty which makes it working for at least 6 months rather than this chinese bats which has no warranty and can be defected anytime. Plastic reminds me  about those chinese bats plastic, similar. Not much durable but performance is good only."
107,1,Stopped working after 2 months.,"1st Day Review: Company should provide a holder that can be placed on a wall or the racket should have a string attached for hanging the racket on a hook. Also on full charge, there should be green light.After 3 months: Red light that indicates that the Racquet is working stopped coming an realised the Racquet was not working.Yesterday came to know from nephew that he hd similar problem but he called customer service and got replacement. But I realise that my purchase was more than 6 months ago so don't know what to do."
108,1,Useless product,Useless product. Isnt working feom day one. And the on off button is so hard that it needs someone om steriods to switch and off.. useless i wonder how its an amazon choice product... Really thought its from hit hencE bought but money down the drain and due to covid dont know how can i avail the warranty too.
109,1,Bad quality and service. Disappointed with HIT brand,"Worst quality and service.  Firstly when i ordered this hit racket,  as per instructions kept it for charging for 6-7 hrs.  But it didn't work at all. Neither torch was working. Faulty piece was sent.  THOUGH I CHOSE Hit FOR THE BRAND NAME AND WARRANTY.  But disappointed with the product.When i sent replacement request,  they accepted the racket but didn't send other piece for so many days and said it is not available.Finally i have cancelled my order today and purchased other company's product.I hope I ll get my money back.  As no records are there in my orders now."
110,2,Conked pretty soon - stay away from this!,"We've been using it only for a few days, works well so far. But seems like a refurbished product - could hear the parts jingling inside on arrival. Will have to wait and see how long it works - most of these conk after a few months.Well, it stopped working completely within 2 months - so, stay away from this!"
111,1,Piece of JUNK sold in the name of HIT,This mosquito Bat from HIT is like the road side buy. It worked for 4-5 days and on 6th day it just peters out! Been swiping at mosquitoes which seem to be standing back and teasing me with the mock of a bat.Feel like a fool!!I would suggest people to buy one of those orange bat Co with a wire charger. It is value for money. The LED in that bat is much brighter. I gave that to my mom. And I got this didn't know what I was thinking. Pity MeAfter 5 days can't even return it
112,2,Godrej is lying.,"Did not expect Godrej to lie. Country of origin as per product details is India. On the cover, its China. Why lie to increase sale? I would not have bought it."
113,1,"Worst experience, used and damaged product",Just 5 minutes back I have taken the delivery. A used product is delivered to me. Light switch is not working. Something battery or some internal part is moving inside it‚Äôs body. There are scratches all around the racket body. Void seal on the box was also broker and the box was build back by tapes. Highly disappointing experience.
114,1,"Worst bat, doesn't help kill mosquitoes","Useless bat. I went by the review and got deceived. It's been 1.5 months since I have this bat, it's has hardly kills any mosquitoes may be 5 to 6 so far. It just doesn't kill any mosquitoes although well charged. Only thing good is its light weight and battery life is good. My previous bat was so much better although it was very heavy. Regret buying this bat... Hardly of any use."
115,2,Not working from the beginning,From day one it's creating problem. Very flimsy and even if it touches clothes etc accidentally  short-circuit occurs at once and becomes out of order. Couldn't register with Godrej hit website because it didn't work for several days. The registration date was over soon. By the time return window was also closed.Can I claim under warranty ?
116,2,Weak plastic make battery rattle,After using two months I am writing this review. Bat looks sturdy but batter socket inside very fragile. Hence battery keeps shaking inside handle.Charger pins are very small and not holds tight. This makes bat to fall due to gravity force.It gives you feel of cheap Chinese products.
117,1,Product of poor quality and stopped working in a week. Not getting charged too,"The product stopped working in two weeks. Now it doesnt hit the insects. Even after charging for 8 hours , the charge doesn't stand for 10 minutes. Yet it claims , it stands for 8 days. Atrocious claim.I have also registered for warranty in their website after the purchase. I have registered for claim. Yet, no one got back to me for a week.I also hold amazon responsible here for tagging this under amazon choice and make me buy"
118,1,Poor quality bat,"I bought because it is branded but Very pathetic product i received .The bat is not charging at all . Only thing i immediately not used the product,used after 10-12 days.kindly after receiving use the product and if return possible do it."
119,2,Would not recommend this.,"Have been using it for about 9 months now and it already stopped working partially. The product is really great in terms of design, durability, build quality etc. and was working pretty well at the beginning but, problem started happening almost after its warranty period of 6 months got over (so, I have no way to even get it fixed).Its battery is draining out pretty soon now and the power button is not working as it should, making it totally non usable at times.I would recommend to buy any cheaper Chinese product (there are plenty in local market) which would last for an year or so instead of buying HIT Anti Mosquito Racquet."
120,5,The best you can find,For years i have been using all chinese brands costing anywhere between 150-300 rupees. The stuff from hit is worth the price. The build quality is good and the battery is no nonsense. Compared to the cheap chinese ones ... the battery on this lasts easily 4-5 times. So no second thoughts of buying this ...
121,1,Cheap quality.,This racquet is of the quality that you will find in cheap racquets that you can get at Rs.150. Plastic is so cheap and flimsy and the on/off switch was already damaged when received. We had 'Hunter' racquet before which was far superior in terms of plastic quality and durability. Don't fall for the brand name. I wonder how this product got so many 5 star reviews!
122,4,Good battery. Perfect shape.,"I had charged it more than 8 hrs. The charging light never went off. But then I been using it for 2 weeks now. Maybe 2 times a day max since not much mosquito yet. The product is great and worth the 500 rs. The charging pin design is fragile though, they should fix its design.The shape is great too. I used to hit things with the oval-shaped bat."
123,3,Nothing great,"It's nothing great compared to any other lesser popular brand, bat misses the sturdiness & battery inside didn't sit properly, it makes annoying sound.The charge comes 2-3 hrs & better life started decreasing from first month itself.Overall it didn't feel like a product from a popular brand in the industry apart from the label on it."
124,5,Hit order,This product I have purchased during July month with 6 months warranty. And after using it for 5  months it's battery is not getting charge and as it's warranty date is 19th Jan we have sent mail to godrej customer care they have confirmed for pick up and replacement and after waiting for 2 days I have asked them to confirm pick up delivery date. No one is giving response. So I request Amazon to inform them for pick up with replacement. Hope you will help in this regard.
125,1,No response from godrej regarding availing  warranty,"The mosquito racket was purchased in Oct 2020 and now for the last one month, it's not working. It's still in the warranty period so I wanted this to be exchanged or whatever... I talked to amazon customer care who provided me with Godrej's mail id and customer care number. It has been a long time and there's no response. The toll-free no. also get disconnected after keeping hold for a long. Highly disappointed by such a good name brand. UCHI DUKAAN FEEKA PAKWAAN. It would have better to get local racket I guess. There's no point in expending 400 rupess which worked for hardly three months."
126,2,Don't buy. Worst experience,HIT anti mosquito bat got defective within warrenty period. There is no response from HIT Godrej including 247.com and their phone number. I tried 52 times over phone. Only pre recorded vouce. I didn't heard a single word from the customer care. No service after sales. Worst.
127,2,Not working after 1 month.,With lot of hope I bought this bat. Worked only 1 month. Now it‚Äôs not working. Company has given warranty for one year. Don‚Äôt know how to contact them. Seriously we need a good bat if price is double it doesn‚Äôt matter. There are more than 10 old bats ( other company) lying at home. Disappointed.
128,2,A good bat with a short life,"Writing this review after 5 months of usage. THE BAT STOPPED WORKING RECENTLY..!!!Initially the bat was working well, good built quality. The battery life of the bat was average and not as mentioned in the specifications.On the whole, it is all like the other bats available in the market and nothing special when compared to other cheaper bats as it all stops working after few months of usage."
129,2,Very substandard product.,Most hopeless product. China make. Bought by seeing Godrej Hit brand name. Very much disappointed. Hardly worked for three months though it comes with six months warranty.  Could not get acces to the portal to register the product for claiming warranty. Other mosquito racquets available at D-Mart for half of this price perform better.
130,4,The after sales service need to be improved.,"Good product by godrej. Battery life is around 20 days with daily 15-20 mins usage. The built could be bit better.Update: Changed the rating to 1 star. My device stopped working so I raised the warranty claim on their website. It's been more than a week no response from the customer service team. I even called the toll free number, but the call going to voice message. Never buy this product. Godrej a fraud company.Update: Received the replacement unit after 3 months and several chasing/followup. Changing the rating to 4."
131,5,Decently good product. Shipping packaging could have been better.,"Pruct look decently sturdy but not the best of its kind but is manageable. It has good power to quickly disengage mosquitoes.In general all mosquito bats are only as good as how well the three layers of the mesh is isolated from each other and this should be maintained while purchase and through the lifetime of its usage. So till the product reach the customer, it's the responsibility of the seller and the e-commerce provider.Packaging and shipping handling wasn't upto expectations as the mesh got damaged (pressed at multiple locations) and a damaged mesh is of no use. Just because I know the principles of how the bat works, I could fix it myself (I used to do this with my earlier bats when someone unknowingly damage it by applying pressure)."
132,5,Received a replacement through warranty,"I had registered the product for warranty as soon as I purchased it here, as per the instructions on the box. There was a glitch with the purchase after the duration for return had passed. I claimed warranty on the Godrej website and I received a replacement after a few days from the brand directly and not Amazon."
133,5,Best bat for scoring big against mosquitoes!,Who loves mosquitoes?Answer is no one.And no one should.So if your house is manifested with these little vile flying creatures and worried about your family members then just buy it and score big against them. Just charge it for at least 4 hours before using it.Pros:1. Burns mosquitoes to death2. Not so heavy so easy to useCons:1. Build quality is not upto the mark2. Battery life isn't as suggested3. Torch isn't powerful for dark rooms
134,5,Product price is justified by the quality.,"The product material is visibly sturdy and durable, as claimed in product description. It is priced slightly above the other similar products, but that's because quality has an edge over other products. LED light feature seems useless, but who cares as long as it kills mosquitoes. Has good battery life too. Conveniently placed charging port. Overall, good product to buy."
135,5,Very good product,I received the product well packed in good condition. Now charging it for 6 to 8 hours as directed. The product is new. It comes with Six months warranty. Product has come will excellent packaging. I am yet to use it. I will use tomorrow and use related review I will write later. After 3/4 months of use a little sound coming out of it. Working good.
136,3,Great product. Does its job,The product is better compared to what we get with those cheap electric batsCons is the usage. Battery life seems to be okish. After few days of usage I m hearing some sounds inside the handle when I move it.And if you are ok with burning some calories while hunting those mosquitoes I would say go for it. Better buy a good quality of the insect catcher. Recently which we are seeing that attracts mosquito with UV light and trap them in a closed space . Or even using a mosquito net while sleeping is more durable cost efficient as well as time and energy saving than this.
137,5,Nice product works superb,"So far so good, works buttery smooth and much better than the other local products available in the market. Battery takes almost 6 to 7 hrs to charge but I believe there is no cutoff once fully charged, at least I haven't noticed that. Easily works 2 to 3 days in one charge. Very sturdy to hold and doesn't seem like getting cracks at minor falls."
138,1,Purposely send defective model during lockdown,"I would never recommend to buy this product as the seller smartly send me an already opened, used product which never worked from day 1, the products box was already opened, the hologram stick was torn and the box was packed with normal tape.Purposely defective product was send since to return the product we have to ship it back to seller which was not possible during lockdown, so the seller knew once we send it, it will never be returned. It was a pure SCAM.Do not buy this product."
139,5,The best mosquito killer,"One of the best mosquito killer bats that I have used so far. I have only charged it once since buying and 3 months have gone by!!! Very sturdy and looks like it will last long enough to get the value for money.Only one precaution though, the electric net needs to be carefully protected. Best if kept in the original cardboard package it is shipped in."
140,5,"Better than all available, no complaints",This racquet is better than all others available. I have been using one since 2 years and one was damaged as I was dropped many times in floor so bought replacement which I have been using since past year.Unless you physically damage it there wont be any problem.
141,5,Awesome Battery Life,"Using it for the last few months, works really well. Battery life is too good. I charge it once then the battery stays for weeks. Offcourse that depends on usage. I use it indoors so no problem for me. It's better to buy this then spending again and again on cheap local onces.One thing I don't understand and possibly like to improve in future generations is the light. The light serves no purpose other than being a blue light. Might be useful reading invisible inks."
142,5,Amazing quality!!,"I have bought many racquets till date but this is the best one. It is very strudy, the battery lasts for a very long time on a single charge, and very high-quality product. Must buy for your household. I bought three of these this year and this is the best racquet !"
143,2,HIT mosquito isn't FIT.,Battery life is very poor. Only the blue light is burning. It doesn't kill mosquito. Surprised to see mosquitoes sitting on it when it is in ON position.
144,1,Do not waste your money,"The product will work fine for first couple of weeks, post which it is just useless. Even if mosquitoes come and sit on the bat it will not get killed. You are just wasting your money on this product. I just cant believe that a brand like hit provide product such low quality. I want refund ... this is pure cheating of our hard earned money."
145,1,DO NOT BUY!,Please do not be fooled by 6 months warranty and choose this. Brand new product did not even last for a month and I got a defective product as a replacement which doesn't even turn on.Better opt of road side ones. You don't have to atleast take the pain of claiming a warranty.
146,5,Powerful Racket,Battery could have more powerfulPlease sell combo packs3500 v...powerful..you can kill big ants too with the shock.. use it for any insects that enters your space inside your house..smart kill. mosquitoes and flies burns into ashes within 3 seconds. This is one of the best fly swatter that I have bought from Amazon. You can blindly go for the buy
147,1,Very Poor Customer service,"Works fine for approx. 2 months. Noticed battery issue after 2 months, contacting customer care is not customer friendly at all. After three consecutive complaints/service request a Godrej representative called and told he'll collect the racquet within few hours. It's been 4days now, I'm not sure which type of watch he might be using. So in short very very poor customer/after sales service which is not expected from this brand."
148,4,Useless LED,"The inbuilt LED is just useless, reasons:1) placement of led is absurd , unless the mosquitoes are very close to the mesh, you cant see them2) the blue light makes it even harder to find mosquitoes, the light blends in the background and the tiny creatures escape quicklySuggestions:1) led should be placed near the ‚Äòhit‚Äô logo , AND SHOULD MAKE SOME ANGLE WITH THE RACQUET, like 30 or 60 degrees2) use another colour instead of blue, use white light instead , of more intensity, intensity doesn‚Äôt matter, you cant sleep with buzzing mosquitoes either3) battery indicator will help a lot"
149,3,Its really awesome when it works but stopped working in 1 month and got it replaced under warranty,Already claimed warranty and now waiting for resolution. Will update the review with the experience.But being useless/dead in 1 month even after using it so carefully!!!!!!Update: The courier picked up and we got a replacement. so far it is working fine
150,1,Stopped working after 15 day use,"Appreciate the prompt and timely delivery from Amazon.The prime expectation from a branded product like Hit is its longevity, which was not in my case. The product stopped charging after 15 days and as it was already past the return period could not return... Absolute waste of money.."
151,3,Good and bad,"Made with good durable plastic, works well.Bad switche, the sliding switch for lighton/on/off is very difficult to operate each time so I leave it on forever. Difficult to hang it anywhere as the hole given for hanging is too small and inconvenient."
152,3,"Gets the job done, but the light could have been better","Several times if I get woken up by mosquitoes in the night, I turn on the lights to spot them. I was looking forward to the light on this racquet so that I wouldn't need to turn on any lights in the room. But the blue light on the racquet is not sufficient to spot the mosquitoes, and I always need to turn on either room light or my mobile phone's torch."
153,1,Don't go after brand...waste of money and cheat in guarantee terms,"Bought it just 30 days before and hardly used...now it is not working....I thought there is 6 months guarantee but when read completely, it says only when we register it under their website within 10 days of buying, guarantee can be claimed...such a cheat..waste of money going after the brand..other brands are better than this"
154,2,It would work for guarantee period of 6 months.,I purchased two nos one by one. Initial performance was good for the first one. So purchased second one. Both worked for 6 months. Guarantee period is 6 mobths no? How it is manufactured for working exactly 6 months. Now no use. You decide to purchase the item.
155,2,Looks good but 3 days in and doesn‚Äôt function as well,"To start off with, the product was great. But within 3 days, the button to press which kills the mosquitoes only works on one side. It should work as and when it‚Äôs pressed but that‚Äôs not the case which is making it very difficult to use."
156,5,Excellent mosquito racquet hands down,"I am glad that Godrej has started manufacturing a mosquito raquet for consumptoon. You can clearly see the quality difference between this and the unknown names out there.Quality is really good guys ,buy it plus there is a 6 month warranty for defects. Fair enuf compared to other products out there that dont have diddly squat in terms of warranty. Got it just today , so need to see long term usage."
157,5,Worthy product,Many of us must be thinking that this product is way a lot expensive than others in the market. But ai would say that it is a smart buy because it comes with 6 months warranty and the quality is decent. It aslo has an LED light which glows. This product is sold by Hit which assures us.
158,4,Very good mosquito bat,"Bought it nearly three months back. Very good battery life. Lasts long and looks quite durable. Better than spending Rs.300 every year for one of those Chinese bats. If it lasts a couple of years, I would be quite happy.Update: Using it for nearly two years now. Still going strong. Don't charge for more than four hours and don't charge daily. Charge only when you feel the juice is not there..."
159,3,Very good product but has some weak parts,"Great product and battery life, but be careful about the 2 rods for charging. They are weak. It is better NOT to slide the rods inside, always keep them outside. Godrej support and warranty was excellent. I contacted them and they delivered a brand-new piece."
160,1,Good product,"Had bought 2 rackets of Mosquito. One is good & second one is defective & not charging at all. Had requested for collection for replacement, but as our Colony was sealed due to Covid19, person was not able to collect. He came twice but could not as nothing was excepted out of our residence. Final request for collection was made on 18th Jan, bur has not come for collection till date. Product is good but service is not provided properly. Hope I can get it replaced for a new one."
161,5,A handy mosquito killer,"I was originally apprehensive about the product, considering similar capability is available in local market at half the price, but this one is super-effective. Ticks the right boxes - Has just the right size making it handy and swift to use, has good battery power and current, ergonomically designed for better coverage and simple design.Not sure about the aircraft grade plastic as it doesn't feel different but does what it promises and does that well."
162,4,Working great and kills lot of mosquitoes,The product is sturdy and battery lasts for decent time.. usually I charge in the evening and then use it. The mosquito seems to move away from the blue light and escape from the bat. Sometimes few mosquitoes escape from the bat though it goes through the bat
163,5,Excellent !,"The quality of this racquet is far better than local market mosquito racquets. The batter backup is amazing - it hardly needs to be charged once a month. The mesh quality is good, so if you accidently hit any surface while killing the mosquito, there are less chances of bending the mesh to stick it to internal circuit, which is common problem across most of the low quality racquets. Totally satisfied !"
164,4,Not worth for prize,Good part is light weightBut battery backup is max 1hr after full recharge. Plastic quality is very poor. Once you turn on the power to kill mosquitos. A motor kind of noice and vibration will come.Over all it kills mosquitos. Doing its job
165,2,Not very durable,I bought it on July 10. By today i.e. 4th Sep the LED light stopped working. Since I did not register this product within 10 days of purchase I can not claim warranty. Those who have registered has to send the product by courier to company and then they will send a replacement. Not worth all the effort.It‚Äôs though strong and battery life is good. Never charged after 1st time until now.
166,4,Best in business,"This is a nice product, very useful to combat the problem of mosquitoes n fruit flies.!It has a retractable plug that can be used for charging, which means no problem of wire n storing that.Once charged lasts for more than 4-5 days with occassional use of abt 6-7 times a day. It hasn't died but I charge it 5 days once, presumably has more life"
167,1,Worst Product for Hit Anti Mosquito Racquet.,"Last month 17 July 2020 . I bought the hit company mosquito bat on Amazon. According to Amazon, the return policy is valid until 4 August 2020. Until then only that mosquito bat has worked. After that that bat didn‚Äôt worked. But all the switches are still working. However, not a single mosquito died. Actually my parents are senior citizens, so I bought this mosquito bat on Amazon to avoid liquid vaporizer. But never expected in such a bad product from hit company.¬†However, the company has given a six month warranty.But such a guarantee is useless. I Tried many times and I still have no answer.üò°üò°Even if someone is planning something to buy this bat in the future. Don't buy!!! You will lose your time and money. I therefore urge you not to buy mosquito bat from HIT product companyüò°üò°"
168,4,Good build and Awesome look,"All seems fine in this product. Its look is quite attractive and build quality is solid. One thing of concern is its battery life. The company claims that in one full charge it can last up to one month and on amazon, it is around 10 days mentioned but my own experience says that it lasts hardly around 1 week. Experiences may differ. I bought it at MRP, no discount was offered, its a bit costly."
169,4,A must have mosquito killer,It is very convenient to kill mosquitoes. The racquet is very easy to use with good battery life. The only problem is the inbuilt charging system which makes it difficult to plug it in . But found it useful to kill mosquitoes in the room and have good sleep.
170,5,Nice product...go for it dont worry about negative reviews,"Awesome product worked as expected from a branded product1.Mirror finish with a great look2.strong build3.long battery life( using it since 25 days after first charge of 3 hours)4.blue led torch is great for dark corners5. kills mosquitos in a single discharge onlyOverall a great product, dont worry about negative reviews initially i was also not sure whether to buy it or not bcoz of negative reviews but i learned that first we should use a product ourself without judging it by reviews."
171,3,Warranty problem,"Issues to get yourself registered for warranty. First FIND registration page, download invoice from amazon (in pdf) and then upload the same (in jpeg/image), submit otp, etc. Then tried to claim warranty (just to experiment), otp never came on email/phone....but product looks good, can't say about its life."
172,5,"This was my Best buy of 2020 ,",I couldn't any racket in local shops due to lockdown there was no stock.This one was really good item and strong one than other brand.They have made the handle and net both very sturdy but only thing was it's charging plug needs to be made little damage proof . What happened was after few months of usage it's a small plastic strip which was holding the charging rods broke in half internally. Thankfully it's design made it possible for me to open the handle and stick the strip with feviquick and it lasted few more months.Light helps too.Will buy it again but pl fix that charging part which was delicate .
173,1,DO NOT PURCHASE HIT MOSQUITO BAT,"Hello All ,I received the HIT mosquito bat on 16 March 2022  and charged it more than 12 hours . I used only one time for 5 minutes ,it not killing any Mosquitos . Again put charging ovder night and not at all killing any mosquito insects.  I am highly disappointed and need to purchase any of good bat . DO NOT PURCHASE HIT MOSQUITO BAT . WASTE OF MONEYI am reviewing again after purching 3 days .I kept continues  charging for 24hrs  and then used 10 minutes to test ,it not Killing  any mosquito . The mosquito bite me and started itchinessI suggest to all . Please do not purchase and injustice to ccustomerThanksRavi"
174,1,I recived not working product,I have recived this bat 28 January 2022. Bat was not working and i have rised request for return this item but no response till 31 jan and 31 jan i have talk with customercare rised the request again but till now no one Amazon agent recived this item and no next update recived on return request.
175,2,Did not expect this from an Indian brand. ‚Çπ500 gone to waste.,"I purchased this back in Jun 2020. The first 15-20 days it worked fine infact I was quite impressed with the product's performance. Soon it started showing signs of problems, I noticed that it was not efficient in killing mosquitoes even in areas were they were swarming together in many numbers. Also only the LED and the blue light were the only functions that were working. Later on I got the product replaced in the warranty which by the way takes 15-16 days to process. The replacement started showing the same issues within 2-3 days. I purchased this for ‚Çπ 500 thinking it's coming from a non Chinese Indian brand which have gone to waste. Did not expect this to wrong here."
176,5,Good bat to kill these small mosquitoes,"Very good quality bat with a solid body. Earlier mosquitoes were able to escape even with the liquid machine but now after having this bat all mosquitoes visible in our home are wiped out every time we see these sucking creatures.Thanks, HIT for this amazing product which is of the very best quality than other available costly bats in the market."
177,4,review after using for 3 months,"It's working great, if I use it daily then I have to charge it after 3-4 days for 5-6 hours. The gap between the nets could be less because sometimes some mosquitoes get away through the gaps. Don't hit any surfaces with this bat, it may cause short circuit. Build quality is good, the buttons are good and working properly."
178,3,Lasted one month,Bad quality product. Lasted a month and then stopped working. The website given to register for warranty also not working. Well done Godrej. Pathetic
179,2,Not worth,"Full manual and not solved the purpose completely. Mosquito ü¶ü should die while touching the net but it is not happening. Hence, applied for the return. Also, you need to keep press the button while chasing the mosquitos ü¶ü which seems annoying.Ordered othe brand bur automatic one and happy with that."
180,5,Impressed but,"I am writing this after 4months usage, till now better working even on rough handling. Fallen so many times, still works impressed with durability. Very powerful enough to kill on single touch. But i felt the battery power has degraded, this may be due to accidental slip from hand to down may times.After 8months still working fine."
181,1,Plzz.. Dont go for the brand name.. Worst buy ever,Its completely useless... Stopped working after 2 weeks.. Not carrying charge after charging for 7 hr... As recommended....When claimed for warranty.. They are not replying even to it... And the customer care number is out of service...
182,5,Very durable and best in market,It‚Äôs a great product to kill the mosquitoes and one of the best in the market . It has a blue led light which is of no use as it‚Äôs not required  But overall racket is of good quality and strong .  Register the product on the website to claim your 6 months of warranty . Would recommend to purchase it without any doubt .
183,5,So good,"I dont like to use chemical mosquito repellants, so such a bug zapper is good. This is so much better than the Chinese unbranded ones you'll find in your local market. A charge can literally last weeks (Lasts around 2 weeks of daily use at night) and it's very sturdy. Pretty goodOnly thing I didnt like was that the blue light is a complete gimmick and does not do anything, but I dont feel thats required anyway so no points deducted for that"
184,3,Good but could have been better,I purchased it in the November but I hardly used this at that time but as of now in April I‚Äôve been using it for 2 weeks continuously and the battery consumption and the clicky sound Of the button is gone and now I‚Äôve to press it really hard to make it work considering this I don‚Äôt think 499 is a justifiable price for this mosquito racket
185,5,Worth buy over all other Chinese make Racquets,The product sturdiness and built quality is excellent. The blue LED light feature is brilliant design feature that you cannot find in ordinary racquets. Added advantage is that you have 6 month warranty period. Worth buy if you consider this for long term use in your house.
186,5,Works well and very effective,I have been using this product for the past 3 weeks. It is effective in killing insects. No complaints so far. Must Buy.I will revisit in few months to update the review. :)
187,4,Not worth,"I can say not worth to spend more money for sake of garuntee and brand name because after only 3 months of usage the performance is quite poor. With 6 months warranty one expect the product will last atleast for 6 months but, it is not the case here. Now I would like to replace it. Will see what the sellers reaction"
188,1,Strong build quality with bad designed battery,Battery shelf life might be there issue. Product is dead on arrival.  Fully discharged and the movement kept it for charging it started giving burning smell in the entire house. Thank god it did not create short circuit fault. Never buy these type of items online
189,1,The seller is sending broken item,"Don't purchase from this sellerStopped working , right after the return window closedNow I lost my money and stuck with a useless productDON'T BUY from hereBuy from a local shop near you!!!!!"
190,2,Blue LED is of No use,"Plastic Quality could have been a bit better. Blue LED is of no use. Even makes it difficult to find mosquitoes in Blue light.Manufacturer is advised to replace Blue LED with a White one, so that visibility improves."
191,1,Not working,I ordered a new Mosquito Bat since the last one I had stopped working after some time. This time I got a bat after charging did not even start. I t looked that someone had used it as normally a tape on the switch when new is there. It was missing and that the mark of the tape which was suppose to be there could be seen. Kindly replace it with a new one immediately. Thanks.
192,3,Battery draining too fast now,"Initially this worked great including battery life. Now after a few months (less than 6 months) of use, the battery is getting drained after about 5 minutes of use. Otherwise, everything else was very good about this. But what use is if the battery backup doesn't last enough to kill all the mosquitoes?"
193,1,Don't go for warranty claim,"My racquet stopped working within 3 months. When I claimed a warranty, they gave an even faultier one after 1 month of applying for a claim which stopped working within 2 weeks. And they don't respond to emails or calls. Their warranty scheme is a scam! Go for the product only if you are not expecting any warranty claims."
194,5,Macchar chumantar,"Excellent productThe best racket  I have ever usedYet another effective product from  Godrej that is working like magicAnd the best thing is, it comes with a 6 months warranty.Go for it without any second thought"
195,4,Excellent product.,"Good battery life.Built is light and sturdy.Looks like it will be durable.I bought one from Flipkart and returned it after about a week. Reason: It was sparking continously when the switch was pressed. And it was overpriced, more than MRP.Will come in again after using it for a month. Hope it lasts.PS: Indian Brand (HIT/Godrej) but made in China."
196,1,Stopped within 1 month of usage.,"Pathetic experience with Hit Brand. We wouldn't get warranty because we didn't register the product within 10 days of purchase, I mean what kind of pathetic rule is this. It didn't even work for 10 days, the moment we started using it, it just stopped."
197,5,Absolutely Worth buying. The only mosquito racquet that is one of it's kind.,This is the best Anti mosquito racquet out there.Very sturdy build and lightweight. The plastic used is of good quality and also it comes with warranty as well.It came in a nicely packaged box with all information printed on the box itself.
198,1,"I do not like China products, so give correct information to customers at your website.",I disliked the wrong information placed at your site.Your site is mentioning country of origin as INDIA. But HIT Racket box is having very clear marking as Made in China.I hate China products.Do you have India made RACKET?Please reply.
199,1,Only 6th month life.,I think it's having only 6 month life bcz after 6 month when your product warranty expire it stop working so plz give warranty at least one year otherwise there's no need to waste money on brand. local product also working the same.. after 6 month when my 1st bat stop working I ordered the same but now it's also not working and I'm traveling a lot for warranty but there is no any option...
200,1,Don‚Äôt buy this please,I bought it last year and it didn‚Äôt last a month. Then I bought 2 Chinese one from a local shop and they are working till today. One Chinese one had to be replaced so since Amazon was only delivering this quickly I again took a chance on hit thinking may be first time I got a defective product but this time it might not be so. But just like the first onethis didn‚Äôt last a week also.Don‚Äôt waste your money. It‚Äôs a few hundred Bucks but why waste it
201,3,Good for mosquito killing. Life of bat is less,I have purchased the bat twice in less than a year. Pros:Very effective in killing mosquito.Cons:Battery life very less. No full charge indicator hence couldn't understand how long it should be charged once battery is down
202,1,Sparking in various parts of the net.,There is sparking in various areas of Net even when it is not in contact with Mosquito. Did not expect this from renowned Godrej Consumer Product Company. Please replace the product. Quality checking is poor. Bad show.Col Warrier
203,3,Very tough to charge this,The product is overall good and is a robust  one. But there is an inherent design flaw which makes it very tough charge. The charging plug has been made in such a way that it is very tough to fix into a power adapter as the plug keeps going back when pressure is applied. Makers must look at changing the plug design for this.
204,4,The spares of this must be made available,The external plastic is better than most in the market . HOWEVER even if one component fails it has to be discarded.No serviceavailable . If there is one it needs to be told. THE CHARGING SOCKET is flimsy and breaks if it falls from the socket so it is advisable not to hang it on a wall to charge but to using a spike/ extension chord and rest it on some surface for recharge. also Battery replacement is not possible because it need to be soldered. The wires and inner electronic components can sepearated and spare parts made available for reuse .
205,3,Be prepared to buy again !!,"initially it worked great - I was getting excited until in 6 month, I discovered the damn thing lose its power and is not as effective, Don't get me wrong - I had not batted not many mosquitoes. this is such a let down and the device only offers warranty for 6 months :-("
206,4,Does the job well,Works well but not useful if mosquito is v small....battery may not last as long as it claims in description. But it is durable....
207,5,Top quality.,Charged only once after buying it and it works like charm. Build quality is top notch. No other brand beats HIT wrt this product.The blue light is useless though. I didn't really understand the purpose behind chosing that color of LED.
208,2,Charging not started. Seller refused to replace,"Look wise it looked sturdy and good. However, when I put it for charging before first use, charging did not start. Even after 2 days of use, charging did not start. Received a defective product and the seller refused to replace it."
209,1,It lasted for 60 days ONLY! Warranty is a scam !!,"There seems to be a battery issue with this product! Ever since I bought this. The battery gets discharged pretty fast! After a couple of months, the battery started draining out and it‚Äôs stopped working finally. Warranty is is scam! I tried claiming it go hit website and nothing happened. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this product !"
210,5,Perfect - review after 11 months usage,"I hardly need to recharge and it works like a charm. I had bought couple of such bats in some shops, which used to stop working within couple of months. This one is perfect, no issues till now..."
211,5,Must buy,"Pros--Very powerful, just one touch...mosquito don't have a chance to survive.- charged only for 4 hours and today is 3rd day still working.- comparison wise quality is far ahead of any other Chinese products.Cons-- blue light is insufficient."
212,5,Love it,Posting after a couple of months of usage. Works very well and roasts those little pests very effectively. Hope it lasts long. Will recommend and repurchase this brand for sure.
213,3,Solid racquet but litte less effective,"The product is having a user manual as it states Off state, power on and power on with LED is the three functions however power on itself LED turns on and not sure why there‚Äôs a third state. LED is blue and not enough bright to locate insects in dark. Also little hard to press the energy button to kill mosquitoes."
214,4,Product is good but only 1problem with service,The product is worth and very good.... Battery life will be good if you follow the instructions of charging...... The only problem faced is to register for warranty claim the website is not working then how can the compan say it has warranty
215,1,Cheap Quality of Materials,"The racquet has very cheap quality materials used, although the advertiser boasts otherwise...The mosquito killer mesh is too weak and the wire layers are apparently clumsy, received a tangled piece, returned, same day."
216,1,No point spending more as my both the purchase were a total disaster in 8 months time.,I bought this product two times just because of the Brand HIT.. But immensely disappointed as both the time product failed working in 8 months time. If this has the durability of just some months I would suggest to buy some low cost product as it won‚Äôt hurt even if it stops working on some months.

218,1,"stopped working ,refund /replace it ASAP",it stopped working after some months of use ...it has warranty period to replace it ..REPLACE it ASAPalthough they replaced .....but  replaced with defective bat that doesn't work ...REFUNDI do not trust your product ...
219,4,Good Battery,I am using this for two months now. I have recharged only three times. I use it daily for 5 to 10 minutes  before bedtime. Previously I have used hunter and vanismart bats. This one has better battery than those bats. Hitting the mosquitoes is comparable to other brands.  No complaints in that.  The blue LED light is of no use. I have not used that light.
220,1,No way to know if its defective or faulty,My godrej nosquito raquet does not spark even when coming into contact with mostquitoes this is worrying to me is this happening frequently woth this prodeluct ols someone help me inhave charged 4-6 hours before first use and followed all instruction but mosquito is not sparking when coming in contact with charges mesh/net
221,4,Reviewing after 1.5 years of usage,Worked fine for 1.5 years without issues. Recently it started giving trouble.Now it is not killing the insect even if it is in direct contact. 200rs Chinese bat will work for 1 year i believe. I will not buy this again
222,1,Worst brand ever,"I have got defective bat, its not working for the first day itself even though been charged, then again I requested for replacement, then once again they delivered the defective or refurbished bat which is not working, In that I can't find any guarantee card, its looks like they opened, thenfinally I requested for refund, totally waste of time, please go for some other brand..."
223,5,super long battery life,this is better than any mosquito raquet i bought in my entire life. charge once or twice in a month only. mosquitoes get blasted at all times. what battery i dont know but excellent. tough plastic. nice design. blue led torch included. great product.All mosquito bats loose their effectiveness after some months because the net becomes very dirty. Dirt covered on the net will prevent insects from making proper contact to get shock. So keep the net super clean for best performance.
224,2,Poorly made,"I bought a few of these for my home which is infested with mosquitoes.A few weeks after i bought them the batteries have dislodged and the charging prongs have gotten stuck. They're basically falling apart, and I don't think they will last much longer."
225,1,Worst product from Godrej Hit,"I purchased the Godrej hit anti-mosquitoe racket Oct 29 and it stopped functioning within 2 weeks time. Inspite of charging for almost 4-6 hours, the bat was not working. Have raised the issue on Godrej hit website with regards to the defective piece which I had received as it is within the 6 months warranty period. I purchased this bat only because the brand belonged to the reputed company Godrej. Looking forward from Amazon as well as Godrej that my issue gets resolved quickly and fastracked, and hope the defective bat gets replaced with new one."
226,3,It works !!,"It‚Äôs a great product but came badly packaged. It had a firm cellophane tape clamped around the switch. Upon removing the tape the whole area has become sticky and unusable. A great product badly packed, makes it an average one!"
227,4,Must buy,"Though the packaging was not good but the product is good. Its features like good battery life, night light, attached pin for charging makes it portable and is one solution for many problems. Just need to be little careful while handling and the product works fine. It comes with warranty and replacement policy makes it affordable and really helpful product. Moreover the brand name is a common household name and is reliable."
228,1,Non buyable product at such price,Very bad product chosen from China by Godrej as it s battery  didn't  last for 10 days lesser than 100rs local mosquito racketI think seeing fake star rating we buy these type of products which r hyped falsely
229,1,Stopped working after a while,"The product stopped working after a short while. Even thought it is under warranty, it has been impossible to reach the seller or the company. After the ""10 day return"" period is over, Amazon is no longer taking any responsibility. We bought this as it came with a warranty -- but it is as bad as not having a warranty."
230,1,Worst experience with this seller for delivering this product to me.,"Worst experience with this seller for delivering this product to me. I had first buy this product and it did not work after 2-3 days so then I had replace that and seller even did not give me replacement product, I am frustrate wit this and then I needed to cancel that product. After one day I had re-order this product and still I did not get that it delivered. Worst experience with this seller from my amazon shopping history."
231,1,Terrible,Terriblw as v difficult to charge .the plug keeps on slipping and the buttons are v difficult to reach .please dont
232,1,Horrible,Horrible product.. worked only for two months . PLEASE DO NOT BUY especially from AMAZON. they do not cover the warranty although i registered the product after buying at their website but no use. Contacted Amazon also many times but no positive respond. very bad experience with Seller and Amazon both.
233,1,Failed within a few weeks,"Very disappointed with this product.within a few days of purchase, the racquet stopped making the usual crackling sounds when hitting a mosquito. even though the mosquitos were still getting killed, it was very inconvenient because it would be very difficult to tell whether the racquet hit the mosquito or not.within the next 2 weeks, the racquet stopped working - all lights were glowing but there was no effect on mosquito, even after charging for 6-8 hours."
234,1,One of the Worst product ever bought.,I tried several times to register on the companies website (as Written on the guide) to claim the warranty but again and again it was showing login failed.It worked only for seven days and then on the 8th day it was fully dead. So I thought maybe battery was dead so I charged it for 4 hours but neither the racket was producing any electricity nor the small led tight was turning on. And I was not able to claim the warrenty.If anyone wants to spend on the racket better buy a chep one.
235,5,Best Mosquito Killer,"This is good product to kill mosquitos, this bat is useful where mosquito density is more and these areas coils and mosquito refills will not sufficient to kill mosquitos. This bat so useful to kill the mosquitos in mass.Absolutely good product to use especially in Farming areas and Gardens, it kills mosquitos in MASS."
236,1,DONT BUY Stopped working after 25 days,"The product is just running on the name of brand , when I purchased this , it was working perfectly , suddenly when the return period got over , the product also stopped working , extremely disappointed , DONT BUY"
237,3,Switch problem,I saw reviews of the product and ignore the comments but after I bought product I experienced same switch problem and they giving 6months warranty but when we planning to claim no one response so useless warranty üò≠
238,5,It is very quick and effective.,This mosquito racket is far better than what I had expected. It is as good as the akari rackets that I was using so far.
239,1,Not durable because the plastic body is very weak. Poor quality not sturdy enough.,It's not very sturdy due to which it becomes less durable. It can't handle some small touches with the other objects kept in the room. So think before you buy this. Mine just stopped working by small hit by the sofa edge.
240,2,PLEASE HELP FOR EXCHANGE OPTION,"I have got HIT Anti Mosquito Racquet  this product ten days back, within ten days it is not working, i want to exchange this product immediately,but order return/exchange portal is closed, mention it is valid for 28 MAY,As per product specification-durabilityHIT Anti Mosquito Racquet - Rechargeable Insect Killer Bat with LED Light (6 Months Warranty)Please do for needful action for exchange option or return,I expected from amazon team will do quick response on it"
241,5,Best Mosquito Racquet Ever,I would say it's one if the best mosquito racquet I ever bought. I was tired buying the cheaper ones whose charge won't stay for long but trust me this one stays longer. The charge stays for atleast 4-5 days minimum.
242,1,Short circuit,"I bought the same model 6 months back and it worked awesome. Even now its working. Now, I bought a 2nd one, which did not work, so I exchanged. 1st day it worked good and 2nd day it short circuited. Now I cannot return as I threw box and the papers in it. Wasted my Rs500+ money on this. It's better to buy those Rs200 mosquito racquet"
243,5,Longer backup,A single charge lasts long.Edit:Review after more than six months of usage.- Battery lasts long- As effective as it was when I purchased- SturdyI bought this for Rs 498 and I recommend everyone to not waste their money on other products in this type. Just go for it!
244,2,Not worth your money,"After the use of 2months, it stops working, poor battery capacity, initially works well and you feel wow about this product,If looking for a short-term bat-like for 2 months. I'm still yet to get the warranty and replace my bat. I'll update the review if the warranty experience is good."
245,4,"Awesome product,smooth warranty claim","I have been using this product for 4 months now. Overall it's a good product.One con is the battery drains too fast and we need to charge it for like 2-3 hours to use for 1 night.As batter drainage was occurring too fast I claimed warranty, I was shocked by their prompt service. They delivered a new racquet within 1 week of claiming warrantyAwesome experience with warranty"
246,1,Don't buy after one month it's stopped working.,"Hi please don't buy this product, after 1month used it's stopped working itself, and its to much cost. In outside markets we are getting very good products with less cost. Please üôè please üôè don't buy it's a geninue review. Battery life worst it's discharging after an hour"
247,2,Defective piece but product is good in general,I don't question the product in general but this time I received raquet which made crackling sound as if it has something broken and I can feel battery moving inside while I swing it to kill mosquitoes. By the way I ordered one from Grofers and that works like a charm.
248,4,Worth the price,After using many mosquito racquetsI found hit on amazonThe name itself indicates the purpose ..Let me say what I liked about the product1) build quality is strong2) battery life is superb3) easy to use -  covers more distance than regular racquets4) worth the price5) Warranty ( where other non branded ones doesn‚Äôt provide warranty )* Rating-  4/5
249,1,Not Worthy,I bought it on Aug 2021 and its not working now on November 2021. It didn't even last for four months. My locally bought bats lasts for atleast a year. It uses lot of power to kill mosquitoes and it runs out of power within 5-10 mins after charging for like 6 hrs. It looks very good and the built quality is very good. It feels very strong but  its not working for me after 3 1/2 months. LED is useless though. Better to buy something else
250,1,Not durable,"I have bought 4 bats in the span of 6 months, all died, only led works. Warranty means you have to take to the service center which will never work. Buying 450/- bucks product and going to a far extreme if city for service means warranty ? Wasting a day in it. Not worth it max. 1 month is its life."
251,1,Stopped working after few days,"Have paid four times what is available in the local market, but this product is worst of all. After 2-3 days its now become so ineffective that mosquitoes can literally play with it easily. I have wasted my money."
252,1,Stopped working received little damaged one,Next morning it Stopped working without any damage. though everything seems fine. and they didn't accept my return. They are asking for self return. Packing was not too good. I received the net  with some damage.
253,1,Defective  Product,"hiI received this product on 26 th of September, already the seal was broken when we received it and on top it the bat is not working properly. Inspite of repeated complaints for refund there is no proper response from your side."
254,5,Good product,I have bought many earlier but these one feels sturdy and different. Somehow the mosquitoes seem to sense and they have disappeared after we bought these. Tested once only . The light helps as in the dark the mosquitoes gets attracted to the light and comes close enough for a suicidal mission. Recommended !
255,4,Good product compare to market products,"Good product compare to markets unwarranted products, warranty process also good, at least we have hope that it will work for 6 months bcz market product have no guarantee they will stop working the next day or in a month or 2 or 3 I had a bad experience with market China made products"
256,4,Good Product.,I have purchased it by seeing the brand name of Godrej. There are numerous company and very confusing their product in the market. It is China made. So I must say you can purchase it and registering your invoice number for six months guarantee in their site. Easy to use and working perfectly. Nice delivery by Amazon.
257,5,Best product against mosquitoes ü¶ü,"Excellent one, strong n sturdy, but a little costly. Instantly burns mosquito, all should have one like this in every home.Thanks Hit ......"
258,4,Good product come with horrible button design,"It has been 10 days I am using this product. I will suggest with a known issue. I got it for 450 rs.ProsBat build quality is good.It was still running with charge that is 10 days back.ConsOn/Off Button design is horrible. Your finger should be too strong to move the button, even that is not enough. I am not hesitate to say it is worst design.I thought to buy one for elders, but not yet because of this."
259,4,"Good product, easy and effective","The build quality is excellent and is very easy to handle. Though, the netting (electrified) can be easily accessed especially by kids, so a word of caution as this can give a serious shock if one touches the net."
260,5,Best and reliable mosquito bat,This item is too good... earlier I used to buy mosquito bats from local market...but no one gives warranty for even 1 hr....it's gone means gone. I have couple of useless bats at home. But this product is amazing....durable...holds charge for 15 to 20 days easily. And obviously it's Hit branded mean a quality stuff....I give five star.
261,5,Superb mosquito bat,"Excellent mosquito bat... Works perfectly well, long battery life even on shorter charge. Also the small blue torch is a nice touch and quite useful. Highly recommend paying a little extra and buying this instead of cheap ones worth ‚Çπ150 from the road as those only last 2-3 months"
262,1,Worst product. Made in China it seems. Never buy.,Never buy this product. It will stop working just after 2-3 days and all you do is chase customer care for warranty. Even the replacement product only works for 2 days max. Don‚Äôt waste your money on this product. Buy anything else but not this. Want to give negative stars.
263,4,"Good product, have been using for a month.",The previous one (unbranded Chinese make) that I was using stopped charging after a few months of use.. This one (HIT) seems to be far better than that. The build seems quite good. The blue light helps in spotting the mosquitoes. It works well for tiny insects and house flies as well. Will only have to wait and see if it can stand the test of time.
264,5,The 6 months warranty is 100% real,"After about 10 days of usage the racquet accidentally fell down and its inbuilt plug got loose (although it was still working), therefore I went on Godrej‚Äôs website as mentioned in the product description and registered to claim the warranty by uploading the amazon invoice. And Voila! 20 days later they sent me a whole new racquet (without giving me any call or intimation lol).The racquet does what it claims and a little bit of charging goes for days. Totally worth the money, go for it!"
265,4,Whether the product is effective in killing the mosquitos....,"Yes.. the product is effective in killing the mosquitos..However, major disappointment is with regards to the shorter period of 'Charge' of the batteries. The batteries need to be charged frequently making it cumbersometo use the product.."
266,1,"Worst product,pls dont buy","Its is the waste of time and waste of money.pls dont purchase.one month I will work properly after that it willl get charge but will not work. Its worst product from Amazon.I didn't except this kind of products from Amazon.customer care doesn't reply properly.for warranty also they didn't give the proper solution.people who all r seeing my review pls dont buy this product.better u can go shop and buy directly, they will give better price and service. For Amazon, pls dont make dealership with this kind cheap products. My request"
267,4,Good but LED light is the only issue,"The bat is definitely better and easier to hold than the ones we get in the market. Only issue is with the LED light, the colour and the placement is very strange. The usual ones we get in the market have a white LED and faces outwards which makes it easier to spot mosquitoes whereas this blue LED is of no use."
268,3,It does the job but stopped working after 11 months,"It is a good quality racket for regulating mosquitoes in your house. I usually use the power mode because sometimes the normal mode does not kill mosquitoes instantly. The on off button is a bit tedious to operate sometimes and I fear it might break someday. The battery backup seems good enough to go on for a few hours, days even if used just for few minutes in a day. Overall it is a nice racket and worth the price and the finishing also justifies the price. :)Edit: After 1 year.  It has stopped working now."
269,5,Go for it,While ordering i thought it's costly then other product. But after seeing it and using it can say value for money
270,5,"Nice finishing, good quality, long battery and light weight",1. Very good quality2. Light weight3. Long battery4. Easy to use
271,4,Overall good,The bat is good. It has power but it does misses mosquitoes due to recharging or whatever technicals involved. But surely better than the other available in markets during covid times. Been 5 months now.
272,5,Works as described.,Been using it since a couple months. Battery life is about 2 weeks - with 5-10 mosquitoes every day. The only drawback is the LED light which is blue in color.Warranty service is legit. Got a defective piece with the LED light not working and have received a replacement after filing a complaint through the website mentioned in the warranty card.
273,4,Maskito racket,It is good now upto it is working good and powerful same power like local chaina products. regarding battery life I can not say and body is very beautiful but it is price to much this is also one drawback this product
274,1,Much below expectations!,"Racqets sold / made by some random local companies are performing lot better than this one. Very much dissapointed. An option to return or replace this is disabled for this product, looks they are just forecebly selling things, exploiting the brand name."
275,4,Good product but early days,Product is as described. Very useful in handling mosquito/fly menace and so far working well. I bought just 3 months back. hence unable to comment on durability or battery life. But good looking product.
276,1,Stopped working,Product stopped working in 2 months.  Now getting burning smell whenever press the on button and doesn't kill any mosquitos.  Also giving huge sound like hissing or getting short circuit.Waste of Money
277,1,"Worst product. Works well for initial days, then stop working. No customer care support responses.","This is the worst product at this price. Bought HIT Anti Mosquito Racquet at a higher price it was coming with 6 months warranty.It was working fine for the initial 10-15 days. After that, it stopped working. Logged complaint 5 times online. I have not received any responses yet."
278,2,China product,"Product review I can write after use of one month. But packaging was good enough and the the product also looks durable.Only negative is inaccurate website description, that irigin of the product is India.But this is a made in China product."
279,2,Fake promiy,I thought godrej is trusted brand. Bat wasn't working within 3 months. I tried to claim warranty and website was popping up a message that mobile number and mail id is invalid though I registered my bat for warranty.False promises godrej and don't trust warranty.
280,1,"Worst product, mesh started burning after 1 week.","i am very much disappointed by HIT Anti Mosquito Racquet, i purchased this Mosquito Racquet because of it's brand name ""HIT"", but it started burning and short circuitting after 1 week. it same as local rackets which we purchase in 150-200 price range.they give 6 month warranty only when we register this product on their website, why it is needed? because they know most of their racket will last for 10 days only, and if any chance customer miss to register they will not be responsible?"
281,1,Don't buy.  Not working within few days,I purchased this after reading reviews and a good brand name but I am very much disappointed. It automatically stops working. It hardly works for 2 months.  Wastage of money .don't buy.. it's better to buy from local shops at cheaper price.
282,5,üòäüò°,"Product is very useful but ,when I m going on godrejhit website for register for warranty , I see this , price is very high,from original price on his websiteAs:- this product price on Amazon is Rs.475/-  and Rs.449/- on his godrejhit website , diffrent in Rs.26/-"
283,5,Best in class product,"Very sturdy build and no wobble at all. Has a small I built UV kind of light which makes it easier to see the mosquitoes. Charge stays longer than any other mosquito bat. Over, the best product in this segment and the price is quite justified."
284,5,Good Mosquito Killer,"This device stands on top when compared to others as it does its job perfectly. Battery backup should have been more, It is recommended to charge for 4 hours before use and u can see it's performance. This hasHit branding on it and need to be registered online for warranty purpose which covers only manufacturing defects but doesn't cover damages caused due to water etc. Usage is simple and quality of plastic is good."
285,4,Quality product and good battery life so far but charging pin is delicate it will break easily.,"I am using it for last couple of months, after first battery charger it lasted for about a month but subsequent charges not lasted for a month. Quality product and good battery life so far but charging pin is delicate it will break easily."
286,1,Defective product,I bought this racket under the impression that Godrej markets reliable and durable productsI was mistakenThe racket stopped working after a month of use even  after a full chargeI cannot avail of the warranty as I did not register the purchase within 10 daysof purchase.
287,1,"bad racquet, worse service",the only reason i bought this racquet was because of its 6 months manufacturing warranty highlight. after 2 weeks of use its incapable of killing mosquitos after full charge. i feel the warranty claim is scam because i have tried so many times to reach their customer care and there is no reply from their end. its better to buy a cheaper racquet than this one.
288,4,One of the best Mosquito killer,"One of the best Mosquito killer bats... Does the job, lasted for 6 months, once charged, last for couple of hours killing mosquito... Blue light is of no use, can't really see mosquito.. battery drains faster, when light is on."
289,1,Faulty product,"The product didn't even last a month. Now that the return window is closed i don't know what to do with it. It said it could last a week on a single charge, but hardly lasted a day. For the first week it was excellent as it kept charge for upto two days use. But now it is hardly of any use."
290,5,Man's best invention since sliced bread!,"The best mosquito exterminator, bar none. I personally zapped over a 100 pesky blood suckers the first day. 10/10 stars. Good build quality at a reasonable rate. Get yours today and blast the suckers."
291,5,"Strong, Sturdy and Useful.",The claim on the battery life is very exaggerated. Or maybe not. For it might depend on where you live. I have to use it daily and the battery runs for 5-7 days on full charge before the blue light and the bat do not work simultaneously. It starts to dim. A good indicator that it is running out of charge. Built wise it is very sturdy and easy to use.
292,5,It's worth buying,"It kill the mosquitoes efficiently. Easy to charge and use. In the beginning, if I charge it fully, it comes for 4 or 5 days. As of now, battery life is good. Need to wait and see the battery life in the long term."
293,1,Never ever buy this Product Again,They will not provide you any solution to your problem they are even don't bothered about the customers problem they deliver you a defective product then you have to burn your energy and mind that is more valuable than the amount of product and the best part of all this is that at the end you got nothing....
294,3,The Blue LED,We have bought first one number and that is still working good. Hence purchased the second one but received defective. Replacement for the defective one also received defective and returning back. Will the supplier check before despatch????
295,4,Not good and battery is getting drained,"During the initial days it worked very well. But,  later after 2 months of usage, the battery is getting dried within few minutes even though it has charged longer time.It's really not up to the mark as per the customer expectations. We thought as It's a branded one from  HIT and its life is good.But,  it's not the case."
296,1,Poor product and bad company support,Product stopped working in 5months only. Even when it was not used frequently. Though I registered for warranty but when I wanted to claim as it is still warranty period. But I found customer care no not working. When u go for online complain they don't send OTP. And u o stuck. Now I have send a mail. Waiting for the reply. So my verdict poor quality product . Poor company support. No meaning of warranty. DON'T BUY
297,5,"Its nice and easy to use, buid is sturdy.",I like the fact that the blades are super sharp and makes fine cuts.. it can even cut tomato in fine pieces. Its totally worth the price and makes a good accessory for the kitchen. its must have for ppl with chats stalls and huge hotel kitchens to make their job easier and with perfection.
298,2,Delivered Product had issues,"Delivered product has not been working properly (not even a single mosquito gets killed by the bat's mesh) despite of following the guidelines mentioned in the manual and charging it to the fullest. I dropped an email to Hit customer care few days ago and didn't receive any response from them till date. Overall, the experience has been quite bad with this product."
299,5,6 Month Warranty is best.,Though my HIT Racquet stop working within a month but thanks due to 6 months warranty the godrej company replace it with new one by courier. But to avail the warranty you must registered on godrej customer care website mentioned on pack within 10 days of purchase.
300,4,"Performs its job well, material looks cheap.","It does its job well, doesn't feel sturdy and the material looks like cheap plastic.  Holding it feels comfortable and buttons placement is well done. The light looks UV-blue and semi circled, although it seems to be of no use.A good bat for its price."
301,2,Not recommended,"I had bought this product last year. Initial 1-2 months, it worked fine. But it's battery life started reducing after that slowly and it stopped working in another 2 months. Considering the price of the product and durability, I won't recommended this product."
302,1,Dint buy....such an wastage,The item got delivered in 27th Oct. And today 20th nov...hardly 1 month and it has stopped working. This was such an expensive of its kind. And who does claim warranty within 10 days and who read all disclaimer of a common item...I am very disappointed
303,1,Don't buy - useless product,"Battery life of this bat is just 15 mins. In 15 mins, the battery gets exhausted and you will have to charge it again. Even if you charge it all day - it will work for 15 mins.And it's quite heavy. Extra weight. Will feel heavy in hand.It's better to buy the 150-200 rs mosquito bats from shopping malls.The colour and material of mosquito bat is good. But that's the only pro."
304,1,"The Racquet is not working as expected, battery life is very very bad",The Racquet is not working as expected. The battery life exists up to 2 hours after a day full charge. In the description it was mention charge it fully once and it will work for a month. Very disappointed with this product. Every 2 hours you have to put it on charging.Please replace the product or refund the money. Looks its a duplicate product. This wasn't expected from amazon.
305,1,Dont Buy HIT mosquito bat worst brand,"Really worst bat and quality within a week it stops working, no use If we call customer care not picks call not able to get repaired. Worst company please dont buy, buy any near by shop Hunter Bat. In name of brand HIT is worst mosquito bat , waste of money."
306,4,Rating,"Product delivers what it promised. Good at performance, in holding Charge and sturdily built. Only I do not understand why does it have Blue LED light source which is not explained in Product description or on Packaging"
307,1,Please dont buy if you value your money,"This bat worked only for a month, and then it stopped working. It not even get charged. Also the toggle button is malfunctioning and the blue light flickers even after charging and not used for than a month. Its better to buy 100 to 200 rs local bat, use and throw. Please don't buy if you are looking for long term. Just sharing my personal experience, I had bought it in Apr 2021. Thank you."
308,1,Absolutely disaster customer service.,"Stopped working within 5 months, although there is no physical issues but it is not working. The customer service isn't responding, the calls do not connect, the mails are hard to be responded. A disaster it is!"
309,1,Don't ever buy this product,"I exchanged twice, but each time the bat stopped working after 3 4 days, so had to finally cancel and go with other brand. 550 for a bat they say charge last 1 week but hardly you can use for 3 4 hours."
310,1,Socket pins not gud,"Ordered this product just by seeing its  brand  ' hit 'Once i got delivery of this  product .. really disappointed for the  improper/ lose socket pinsWhenever i want to charge this bat  facing huge problem to plug into the socket., Some time  it will charge  and  some time it wont charge because of that lose pinsReally not expected this from this type of reputed brands"
311,2,Bad experience,"The battery does not last for long not even for two days when charged for 4hours, forget about a month. This is highly misleading to mention that it can work for a month with full charge of 3-4 hours. I purchased it few weeks backs and m not sure if it will sustain this season...."
312,5,Product registration not possible.,"All super. Excellent. For warranty, you have to register the product.  They have a toll free number which never works. Sent a email on Sep 7, to care@godrejcp.com requesting for registration. No reply from them till date. So Amazon can integrate product registration on each purchase to avoid such hassles. Product good but service is not satisfactory.  Who has time to follow up each purchase like this."
313,1,Stopped working just after the warranty period,"I purchased this product on 28 Feb 2020. As HIT is a reputed brand and also as it comes with 6 months warranty, I selected it, though it comes at a much higher price compared to the similar products in the market.But today this stopped working on 01 September 2020 which is just 6 months from the date of purchase and when i feel being cheated by this Chinese product."
314,5,This is the best don‚Äôt buy junk,There are many rackets available . But this made by HIT a reputed company is far superior ! Good finish and strong product . I have wasted ment on others before which are cheap and last a month or so thos one looks and functions really well ! Good to see people selling good quality products than just trying to sell cheap things
315,5,Quality Product,"The best mosquito racquet I‚Äôve ever bought on last 10 years, reasons being:1. Battery life - it‚Äôs been 7 days since last charge. I charged it full For 8 hrs.2. Robust construction - the racquet feels durable to hold and use, the plastic for sure a good quality ABS, I‚Äôm not sure about aircraft grade though!3. The ZAP is quite effective , one single ZAP is enough for a mosquito and it‚Äôs quite assuring as well!"
316,3,"handle it delicately,it will last for months","You have to handle it carefully without hitting couch, wall, bed as it starts malfunctioning soon if its being hit on objects. Otherwise it will work great.Mine started malfunctioning soon after a month because I dropped it on floor couple of times"
317,1,Returned the product and got rock light instead,Bought this going by product name. However within 2 days found that wires in racquet are easily pliable and touch each other. This cause racquet to emit sparks when armed. Returned the product within 7 days for full refund.Purchased rock light(chinese product though) from local shop as mosquito menace is quite high in our area and couldn't wait for next order from Amazon. That is performing well and my wife calls me the Gopichand of mosquito swatters.
318,5,Best In The Market,It's the best Mosquito Bat in the market. The build quality is significantly better than the competition. Claiming the after sale warranty is fairly easy. Just don't forget to register the product for the warranty.
319,1,This product does NOT work at all.,"Do not go with this product reviews. It doesn't work. We ordered it seeing the brand name, though a branded company would definitely provide the best but we were wrong.. it's a total waste of money. You may try if you wish üôÇ"
320,1,Poor quality,Please don't get fooled with the brand name. It just stopped working after 6 months and warranty period was also over to claim. Built quality seems good but not durable and overpriced product. Unexpected from Godrej.
321,1,Product failed in less than 6 months of purchase,The Racquet stopped working in less than 6 months of purchase with no warning what so ever. It just stopped working in a day the only issue I could see was a rattled battery pack making some noise inside the handle.Hit can you let know how I could process the said warranty. You have to make it clear on claiming warranty either on Amazon page or product itself.
322,1,Worst product,Don't waste your money on this bat....regular low cost mosquito bats are way more better and work for a longer time....this bat's button is not functioning properly only after 3 months of use..... please don't buy it by seeing the brand name (HIT)......never expected such products from HIT company....bad experience....
323,1,Cheap  product,"Worked only for 1 and a half month. i checked for warrenty as it mentions for 6 months but mere cheatingnothing worked no response .i send mail still no response , i called customer service  according to the number given from Amazon customer service..no response...please dont buy...mere cheating from godrej side."
324,1,Thinking whether it's a hit bat or something,"At first use it worked so well but from 2nd use should charge daily....and even 2 times a day and for warranty they give a website in which u can't register the product that the ""GREAT"" thing and better do t buy the product and if anything happens no warranty can get from the godrej side....."
325,4,Ozone smell while using,"The quality of the product is good compared to the cheap 100-200 Rs versions available, The Blue light provided helps to track mosquitos. But there's an Ozone smell while using teh product it can be due to high voltage components (Just my thought not sure of why it happens). Also, the handle was broken while got the product. But overall happy with teh performance"
326,4,Good product,Excellent in doing what it is supposed to do! Good battery life. But there was something broken inside the handle and was making noise. Quality check could have been better before packing.
327,1,Useless,"Useless product, stopped working within a month with very less usage. It has 3 step button switch, it is so tight one should employ a body builder to switch it on. Don't spend premium for this...just go with the normal one"
328,3,Charging Red LED Keeps Glowing,"Its been almost 7 hours for its first charge and the Red Charging LED keeps glowing, how do i know if its fully charged or not. Is the Red Charging LED gonna switch off soon or should i remove it from charging now"
329,2,Not Good,"One charge 1st time has lasted more than 6 days. Have been using from August2016  battery charge stands for not more than 1 day, drains faster .I have bought  3 Mosquito Rackets.  All 3 failed in just more than  6 months and the last one failed in1 month. Replacement & guarantee claim or cumbersome process"
330,1,Don't waste money,Utterly disappointed with the so called brand hit. I can use the racquet to play tennis/ badminton rather than killing mosquitoes. The mosquitoes happily flying through the nets of the racquet.
331,4,Good build quality mosquito repellent,"It looks study. Using it from two weeks without charging. Received it with charged. It works perfectly. For warranty claim registration require from manufacturers website. But price is higher than local brands.Edit after 1 year usage, it's working & no issues so far."
332,1,Good while it lasts... which is until warranty expiry,"I bought this given a branded name after buying multiple bags which lasted only a few months. Worked very well for first few months, but then just stopped working. It charges still, but none of the buttons work! And of course, warranty is over, probably by design. Avoid."
333,1,Stopped working within a month - China product,It stopped working within two weeks. Its been 3 months now I'm trying to reach their customer care for warranty. They are not reachable nor responding on my email or voice message.Country of origin is China.Money wasted.
334,1,Faulty product delivered. Not working.,"Product arrived defective, as after charging it for 3 hours  also it did not work. Only the Blue LED light was glowing but mosquito mesh was dead. I registered the product on Godrej website and made a claim for warranty. Awaiting pick up as the company has assigned a courier co. Lets hope they don't disappoint again."
335,3,Dissatisfied and disappointed üòû,"It's just like other cheap raquates....didn't find anything extraordinary even after spending more, mosquitoes pass through it without getting killed most of the time....so I am dissatisfied....won't recommend this costly buy...."
336,4,Battery expected to be better,Very sturdy built and the product feels solid. But probably they have given NiMH cells in it which are outdated and suffer from memory effect. Instead expected LiON cells for better performance. Lasts only for 30-45 minutes at high mosquito density area. Still much better than flimsy and cheap Chinese rackets.
337,5,Good product- durable and quality!!,"Better than any other Racquet in the market. Sturdy and elegant design.you can feel the quality in the grip.3 months of positive experience.Mistakenly, I smacked the racquet to the ground while targeting a fly... Amazingly, it sustained it!!"
338,1,Only worked for one day,"I missed the returnable within 10 days clause and took my sweet time - a couple of days - to open it's package... charged it... used it for a night...That's all... It didn't work after that at allI tried charging it the next day and use it but it still didn't work, repeated the same another day -- didn't workBy the time I was convinced it will not work, it was already 10 days post purchase"
339,5,Sturdy and Excellent build up,"Very sturdy and good quality plastic.Recommend.Nearly 3 weeks of usage, till yet not found any drawbacks.Definitely update, if any drawbacks found.Recommended product"
340,1,poor quality. stopped working after 8 days,bought 2 of them. one gave up after 8 days one still continues to work. looks good but not sure how long it will last. quite a fragile product. the warranty process is unclear and not worth it for such low cost stuff.
341,1,Not working . Poor,The product quality feels good but how good it is when it doesn‚Äôt fulfill the basic purpose of killing the mosquitoes. They simply dance on it and fly away. Definitely a defective piece all within 10 days and even the warranty card is not getting processed. Sad
342,4,Does the job,"After a month usagePros - Build, Battery life (may be it's new so), kills flies instantly, handlingCons .. mesh looks delicate and price.Right now. Best in market. So go for it."
343,1,Delivered used / not working Racquet,"1. Packing was average with half opened, which I felt ""That's ok""2. The seal on the ON/OFF switch was torn / removed which is very apparent that it is used. Could see scratches all over the Racquet.3. When I checked, it doesn't work at all.4. Finally inside the box, I found the invoice of the previously used customer who returned it.OMG... too worse even from the top rated seller. I had to return, ended up depressed"
344,5,Worth your money,"Very Effective, with a durable Battery life.Although worked for 6 months only ,But still worth it. Better than the ones in market with low prices of unheard brands."
345,1,Stopped working within a month.,The product stopped working within a month as soon as the return window was over. Now it‚Äôs just a toy. Dint expect it from a brand like HIt. Bought a local product that works perfectly even after two months. Don‚Äôt order this.
346,4,Sturdy and glossy finish,Of course over priced. But built quality is better than cheap version. But not hugely better.Body finish is good. LED light is a gimmick. Not very useful.MADE IN CHINA !!!!
347,1,Battery not charging just after warranty period expired,The battery stopped charging exactly 2 days after the warranty expired (6 months and 2 days that is). Showing out of warranty on website and I am left with a useless product!
348,1,it doesn't worth it's money. not standing up to the brand value,"The plastic looks great, feels great but breaks easily. No proper quality check done before designing the product, the plastic and design mechanism near the charging end is set to fail, set to break unless used so gently."
349,1,"Poor life, zero reliability","Very bad. Bought it and within a month it has stopped working. Not sure about its warranty also. Since return period on Amazon is also over, I feel this is wastage of money . Other local brands seem sturdy, this will surely ruin the brand name of HIT."
350,1,Charging failed in 4 months. Worst experience with warrenty claim,"I believed Godrej & got 3 bats.Of them 2 bat's failed to charge in few months. While warrenty was claimed & customer care told me bat will be taken & replaced, after 2 weeks of wait it didn't happen and to my surprise claim warrently status back again & I have claimed again. Worst experience with product. Local bats are supporting much better. I suggest to buy other products. Don't go by just points and brand. Waste of money & time."
351,5,Wonderful product,Very nice sturdy n light weight product as compared to other rackets that I purchased earlier from market but they hardly last for few days to few months.this time I ordered it from Amazon and got 6 months warranty.thanks Amazon for early delivery.
352,2,Life is very less,Bought it in sep 2019 and used it very less as I had one more. Since last one and a half months it has started giving problem. Fully chrged battery dosent work for more then a day or two. I have to charge it every other day
353,1,Don't Buy. It stopped working after first recharge!!,Don't buy. After first recharge it stopped working. Never expected such a worst experience from M/s HIT. I have bought one from a street vendor one year back and is still working perfectly and half the price!!!!
354,3,Unable To Register For Warranty,"First of all the raquet is great.But when i went to register my product for warranty, their system does not sent any OTP for registering hence my product remains unregistered for warranty. And i think when there arises a situation of claiming warranty, they probably would tell that i should have registered the product. Genius Minds you see.Keeping this issue aside the product is awesome, well built, nice battery backup.Lets see how many months it works."
355,5,Worth the price.,"Been using the China ones available in the market for years, but this one is far far ahead from all of them. Build quality is sturdy, doesn't feel flimsy. The power output to the mesh is high too, instantly kills mosquitoes in a snap."
356,3,Charge gets drained too fast!!,"It's mentioned as ""lasts upto 1 month on full charge"" but that's not true. I use it like for some 5-10 mins everyday at night but still it won't work well on the second day after full charge."
357,1,FAKE PRODUCT NO WARRANTY COVER,DONT BUT ITS WASTE OF MONEY AS THERE IS NO WARRANTY. THE RACQUET STOPPED WORKING IN 3 MONTHS AND SINCE PAST 4 MONTHS GODREJ IS YET TO REPAIR OR REPLACE. GODREJ SHOULD BE CHARGED FOR FAKE CLAIMS ON WARRANTY
358,5,Go for it!,"Works like a charm... It's been almost a month, I just charged it to full when I bought it.... That's it. Battery life is surprisingly good...Way better than those Chinese one's...Build is sturdy..."
359,1,"Not a good product, warranty is waste","Racquet had charging issupaes and not upto mark. Warranty they will ask you to go to some 50Km far off centers to fix your product. Drop and collect yourselves. Why on Earth I will take a product that can't provide proper service center in city like Bangalore... Leave tier 2,3 cities. My 2 cents ... Do not buy.... Pathetic product and customer care plus their service providers are of no use..."
360,5,Just go for it,"Dont buy local bats just bcz they are cheap. This one is the only branded one available and it is full justice with hit name. Sturdy,strong built and good quality bat. Works so well. Invest without hesitation"
361,4,Value for money,After 1 month of use (used 6 times so far)1. Nice battery life - Charged only twice in more than a month time.2. Kills big and medium sized mosquitoes ü¶ü3. Misses smaller mosquitoes and wet garbage flies. Have to dirty our hands.
362,5,"Received good products, really worth it üëç","Battery life üëç , 7 hrs charge will be lasted for one month. I bought 2 No's on last November. We're using it every day. Used so many brands earlier, but this is the one really worth itüëå...so far didn't face any complaint. Only problem noticed- I tried to register it for warranty benefits online but the site is not functioning properly.‚òπÔ∏è"
363,1,It's been just two months and it almost doesn't works. Disappointed with Amazon,It's not a proper product. It's been just two months and it almost doesn't works. I purchased it earlier from somewhere else and it worked for a year and half and this one is just not good. Battery goes down inspite of charging for the whole day. Disappointed with Amazon
364,5,Well product,This review after the 2-months of purchase1- charged on day 1 when it was purchased. Again charged after 50 days on normal usage average 15-20 times striking per day. no doubt in battery life till now.2- soft and minimalistic design so feels soft & sturdy in hand.3- plastic quality is good enough so no scratches on body.3- main wiring mesh area is well designed so trap mosquitoes easily.4- charging pins design as usual same in all mosquitoe bats.5- led is beneficial in night .Cons:-1- price is bit high than normal bats.
365,5,Love it!,"Super awesome. Love the fact that it is sturdy, effective, comes with a light and charges up fast. The other Chinese racquets that I had bought died within a month, this one has been going on for the past few months. So, fingers crossed."
366,4,It will always be somewhere else when you want to use it!,"OK for the occasional flying insects that you might be inclined to chase; and you better have good vision and rapid reflexes.Reassuring to have one, but hardly useful."
367,1,Worst Product ever made by HIT,"Worst Product ever made by HITFirst of all, due to  heavy weight may you feel pain while pull the bat, 2ndly poor batter life every 1/2 hr total usage you need to charge it.3rdly, company claim its have 3500v but reality is totally differentSometimes mosquitos and ants are just falling down due to get shocked! Sometimes not everytimes"
368,2,I can't claim in warranty policy as manufacturer given 6 months,I have purchased in February 2021 it was working for one to two months was good after it was stopped working only Led light is on but even still as of now today I can't able to claim in warranty policy as manufacturer saying 6months warranty if I claim in warranty only registration details you can enter once if you upload your invoice it is not showing completed think and buy of this product friends don't waste your money
369,4,Oops,"I bought this pre covid. Once covid hits I'd to leave this at my room and move back to home town and have been working from home for 2 years. I forgot how it worked, I just want to leave a review because amazon keeps asking me to leave a review. I hope my landowner hasn't sold the item. Will update this once get my hands on this product."
370,5,Good Product Satisfiedüëç,"Good product, real monster for killing mosquito and insects.Battery is running more than 5 days per charge.Racquet built quality is strong. Packaged very nicely.Godrej is always deliver good products."
371,2,Performance is not up to mark considering it cost comparing other local made.,It's battery get discouraged very quickly even though charging for more than 8 hours like other local market bat. I have purchased on 24.12.20 and is used for only for little than 2 months.
372,2,DONOT FALL IN THEIR MARKETING TRAP,"Battery life sucksWill hardly last 30 mins after charging it for so much time..But okay people i know many of you would read thisThe marketing strategy that they used was brilliant400 mah and all the loaded crap!!But DO NOT FALL FOR IT!!!Its nothing its actually worst than what you get on those racquet you get for a 100 bucks outside..Also, the so called blue lights its of no good too"
373,1,Poor quality product,"Product will last more-or-less within the warranty period of 6 months. After 6 month, this product started showing defects. Three or four local products can be purchased one by one with the same price as this product and can be used for much more than a year. Overpriced product with a brand name and low quality."
374,1,One fresh hot garbage coming right up.,Bought this after having bought many other local brands with the expectation that I won't have to worry for a year. Scratch that the piece of hot garbage ran out on me in a month. Absolutely pathetic product with it's brand name being the only selling point. Trust me you're better off buying cheap local rackets atleast you know what you're paying for.
375,5,Brand speaks for itself,since many chinese bats are now missing in the amrket also other online stores & super markets not able to sell due to non availability i ordered this one but stand true to its use with very good battery back up and does what it is designed for to kill flies & mosquitoes
376,5,Best choice,Just go for it for better performance. In local at low price we can get so many product equivalent to this one. But the performance which is giving from Hit mosquito bat is awesome. Nothing will beat this that much high quality material used
377,1,Complete waste of money.,Worst racquet. Stopped working in 5 days. Amazon replaced that. Another racquet delivered but that was defective. Refund request initiated. Don't go for this.
378,1,DONT BUY THIS,"Please don't buy this productIt will work for only 2 months, In the month of October I buyed this mosquito racquet but it was not working.Then I got replacement for it within one week but it is also not getting charging now and stopped working in within 4 days. They sent defective product, when I tried for customer care they simply said to send mail, but after sending mails many times they won't even reply."
379,2,Battery short circuited,Battery short circuited immediately on putting in for charging (with black smoke) and tripped our electric supply ..  had to discard the racquet. Could not return as I had discarded the box it came in.
380,2,cheap chinese mosquito racquets are better at killig mosquitoes !,The bat does not do what it is supposed to do - electrocute mosquitoes . In fact I tried it in a group of more than 20 flying insects i tried fruit flies since it was useless with mosquitoes) . It managed to electrocute only 2-3 . Since it has a warranty ..would appreciate if u can give their contact email to correspond with them .
381,5,Very useful,Very useful. Very sturdy. And a champion insect killer. Didn't realize my room was full of mosquitoes till I used this. Good product from hit. It's better than the spray!
382,3,Without light it is not working.,"There is three stages button. Off, on without light and on with light. My bat does not work on without light from the day one. Other wise feels firm in hand. Also looks good."
383,1,"Worst product, stopped working after a month","Writing this review after couple of months moderate usage.Worst product, it stopped working with the same spark in month. And totally stopped working after 2 months.  Waste of money."
384,4,Good quality,Very good quality plastic & well made. Has a blue led light on the inner frame - not sure if it's to see in the dark or attract the mosquito towards the mesh. Works well but only irritating fact is it make a ' tic tic ' sound.
385,1,"Stopped working in a month, (second Hit racket in 2 months)","I thought Godrej would take care of quality control, not so.This is the second Hit racket that has stopped working a little after purchase.The previous one lasted a couple of months, this purchase only one month.The blue light comes on, and it is fully charged, yet there is no crackle when I pass it over mosquitoes anymore.Will this be replaced under WARRANTY?"
386,1,Useless product. Battery dead in less than a months,"I was fed up of local racquets and hence bought this thinking this comes from a reputed brand. To my dismay, this is worst than locals ones. LED went kaput first and now the battery is completely dead with minimal usage in less then a month. Look elsewhere"
387,1,Product is not working at all and received damaged piece.,"Initiated return on the same day I received the product.But the return service person haven't contacted or tried to reach but got message saying the customer was not available during pick up.Raised this concern to customer care where they said it will be picked up in next 2 days, but no updates nothing so far.Not sure if it happens within the return policy date"
388,4,Lasts long - works perfectly,Before buying this I tried couple of racquets but none met the standards of this one. The best thing about it is the battery life. It has been more than two weeks and it is still working after its first full charge. I strongly recommend this if you are looking for a stable mosquito racquet with a long battery life.
389,1,Used product was given to us,"When we opened the package, we noted that product was not new piece but a used one. When the button was on, it was having current without us charging in at all. The racquet had all dirt, small feathers & web on the net. It is a used piece that is been given to us. Really bad."
390,1,Horrible! Don't EVER buy this crap,"Such a pathetic product. It worked fine first twelve days and then stopped working. As I tried to replace the item, realised the replace window closed in ten days from the delivery!Don't be fooled by 'hits brand, it's a useless product"
391,5,Good product but Chinese.. .,"Robust product. Battery life is more than one month for single charging.But product is Chinese. Think before buy, it's only negative point.I am using from last 3 to 4 months. This is best product performance wise. I recommend to buy if you are looking for durability.  One charging is enough for 2 month."
392,3,"Not very good experience, it's fragile...","Bought it for around Rs.550It was a great device to get rid of mosquitos and other insects, but after 3-4 months it stopped working , only the led is working . I charged it several times , still it no longer killed mosquitos ,so it's not as sturdy or durable. As the lockdown started I couldn't claim the warranty either , and gradually it went out of warranty."
393,1,Poor quality.,"Did not last even one month, the bat doesn't work anymore. The light is still working but not the electric bat doesn't. Apparently it comes with a 6 month warranty but dont know whom to contact."
394,5,Nice moskito killing bat,This is nice mosquito killing racket but first I received this product broken from net then I replace it. After replacement I got this bat nice now it is working well overall nice product
395,1,Substandard product,I bought Anti mosquito racquet last year April and it worked fine until this year. The plug got broken and I ordered another one because of its good performance but this time the racquet stopped working within a month. Putting this review as somehow I feel the company either is manufacturing substandard products now or has changed its manufacturer.
396,4,Better one with a little bit high price. Worth the money it takes.,"I got the product today so Sturdiness, Battery life, Durability is yet to be tested. But at a glance the product is way better than the local Chinese rackets. I got it for 311.00"
397,1,Stopped working right after 3 months,"I had purchased this mosquito racquet on 23rd November 2021. It was working fine till 20th February 2022, then it suddenly stopped working. The only thing working in the racquet is the LED indication light and LED spot light. Worst purchase. It has nothing to do with the company name. Only the company‚Äôs name has ‚ÄúHIT‚Äù in it but the racquet isn‚Äôt ‚Äúhitting‚Äù any mosquitoes"
398,3,Brand value doesn't matter,Well i thought that this one should be better than the ones available locally because of brand. But it's not like that it's the same thing. So don't go for this rather go for local shop and buy where you can atleast test the product.
399,5,Worth the price tag,At first I was very hesitant to buy it due to the 499/- price tag; especially since at local stores you can get it for close to 150-180 bucks. The local store products although work well are very delicate and need really high maintenance (have to be very careful while handling them).This has turned out to be a really good buy. It is rugged and has taken quite a few falls. There is no give in the racket shape and the battery is still going with only being charged once in between
400,4,A bit defective but still usable,"The push out mechanism of the bats are a little defective, as they need to be pulled out for charging instead of sliding out when pushed out. But they are doing an effective job of zapping the thousands of mosquitoes we have at our place!!"
401,5,Good product with impressive battery life,"My usage of this mosquito bat is limited. As per my observation, the body built of this bat is decent and the finishing is nice. Battery life is impressive. I would recommend buying this bat if you looking for one online."
402,5,Best in quality,Brought it for ‚Çπ399. Very sturdy product with decent battery life. It comes with 6 months warranty which is genuine and process is simple. The one originally purchased had an issue with the battery but got it replaced as it occurred within 2-3 months of purchase. And the replaced item is now working fine for over a year now.
403,1,Failure - not working - it failed to work within 6-months - scrap and brand HIT is a misleading,"This has 6-months warranty. I brought in Aug-2020 and now Dec-2020. This is not working. I need replacement or money back. Though it seems  am reporting in 6th month, it is not working from many days before."
404,5,I trust Godrej. Bat is satisfactory.,I purchased it 2 months back. . So far I am very satisfied. I can't  comment on durability. Bat is sturdy. Battery charge is holding. It also depends on how carefully we use without banging it on chairs or table corners.I bought it because it is from the house of Godrej. I trust Godrej.
405,1,Defective product it's  not working from the day first,It's  not working from the day first
406,5,Waste of money.  Third class racquet.,"Price could be less.  It's easy to use. Lightweight with amazing look.  Will update more after using for few days.So,  after a few use,  not even a month,  it's led light not working.  Racquet even not working properly.  I thought it's a brand of Hit so it would work good,  but I was wrong.  It's a third class racquet.  I request everyone not to buy this racquet.  Waste of money."
407,5,Very good light and sturdy mosquito racquet,"The mosquito racquet is very light but pretty strong and sturdy. Due to light weight of hand stays agile to change path along with mosquitos. So, we have higher success rate in killing them. The battery life is very good too. Not recharging even once in two weeks. I also have  Nippo racquet, which is really solid but pretty heavy too, because of which our hand can't move fast enough."
408,1,Don't buy,It is better to buy local 200rs racket than this. The button to press up down got loose in 2 days and the bkue light got dimmed in 5 days. The current is also not effective.
409,1,Same as Platform level quality! Wroked only for one month!,Don't waste money on this product! Better to buy on platform at lower price! Worked only for one month and later stopped working! Third class product with a brand name!!
410,1,Wastage of money.,I bought a Hit anti mosquito racket.its not working and you cannot return it to the seller.about warranty it's misleading as you cannot contact the seller so where will you get the warranty.never buy from sellers who have no return policy.wastage of hard earned money.i had to give one. Star as without that you cannot post a review.
411,5,Excellent Product,It discharged after hiting insact. We have to again press power button for activate electricity after that only next insect will be die
412,1,Very bad service of Godrej hit,"Very bad service when comes to warranty .i have claimed for warranty and my product was in the warranty period . However on multiple calls and email , no reply from hit service centre or I can say very bad Godrej product and services. Infact customer care number is not valid . Would recommend not to buy this product ."
413,1,received damaged product,Damaged product received but the return window got closed as we opened the packet after some time due to COVIDPictures show that the charging pin is damaged and only one pin comes out ....How to claim 6 months warranty as I have bought this on 2/09/20. Kindly replace.
414,5,Rock-solid mosquito racquet with LED 4 darkness.,Rock solid Mosquito Racquet with in-built LED light to spot & kill mosquitoes. Build quality is so good that it feels like one can play tennis with it. Functions as exactly expected. There's one issue though and that's the charging plug being weak.
415,1,Stopped working within a week . Product quality not good now,It was a good product earlier. When I bought it second time last month it's charging pins stopped working Within a week. Couldn't return it as we're not well .product quality has gone down now .high price low performance product now.
416,1,damaged product received two times,"Pathetic service by seller. First time product was not working , when asked for replacement they delivered damaged product , which was clearly visible"
417,4,Working fine,"The only reason why I didn't give 5 is bcoz I couldn't register my warranty. I bought this about a week back and it is good and working fine. I specifically bought this on seeing 6 months of warranty, I got a paper saying I must register in that provided link(hit website) to claim in future. But I couldn't register and it throws some sql error."
418,2,local vendor selling at rs 150  godrej at rs 400,"bought in lockdown. Local vendor selling at rs 150 and rs 200 .Quality is better ,but after mosquito is trapped , it falls on ground when switching button on, not killing mosquito completely"
419,3,Expensive,It has been 3 months since i bought this mosquito bat. It worked really well initially but now it has stopped working and does not charge anymore. Just charged it for about 6-7 times in 2 months. I don't think the durability is as promised. Too expensive!!
420,1,ONLY WORKS FOR A WEEK,The product was fine for a week. Then the first problem was1) it didn't kill any mosquitoes because of absence of sound2) next the red light didn't work3)  next the button has gone inside so it's impossible for it to work4) poor costomer service because they don't replace it and only gives an option to refund.A horrific purchase. I don't recommend using it.
421,1,Bad quality and user friendly. Outside China products are friends better than this useless hit.,"Rechargeable plug is very very bad. It's not moving quickly and easily. It's tough to move.  It's getting stickup during movement.Such bad quality product from Hit.  Bad recharging. Amazon, please stop this kind bad products selling."
422,1,Deffective product supplied. Please replace,It is not killing a single mosquito. Product is defective and absolutely not functioning it's intended function. My money spent is totally waste. Grateful if you can replace the item
423,5,Quite great in all insect killer,Never use chamical or other liquid that harms breathingThis one is stronger and best battery life. As well easily repairable at home or nearly store
424,1,Very Bad Product - Updated July 2021,Not up to the mark...Saw the Brand and thought it would be upto the price and Brand Level.Bought it 1st time...The product Quality was bad...was not working in 7 days of operationI returned it and replaced it...but again received damaged product Now will be again returning this...The problem is either with the Brand or with the Supplier.Request-Do not buy the product... Feedback date July 2021
425,3,Chinese ‚Äúmake for India initiative ‚Äú.,It works on battery power. If battery and circuitry fails it fails. So sturdy and durability does not comes be a factor for application. Made in China ‚Äúmake for India ‚Äú- initiative for Godrej.
426,5,Completely worth the price,Merits:- Ease of use- Good quality- Can be used roughly- Very efficient against mosquitoesDemerits:- The battery needs to be charged daily.(Putting it as a demerit as its mentioned that the battery lasts really long)
427,1,Disappointed with the product,I have purchased the product four monthsbefore. Now its not working. What happened is either the blue or red light not working. Such a waste of money. Now only I'm going through the reviews. So kindly go through the reviews so that you will not buy the product.
428,1,Hit website and Customer support not working,"Looking like I have wasted my money on buying this product with high price and helpless when trying to claim warranty. So be aware customer support is 0. I brought this product by seeing warranty, warranty does not works and you will not have any other option, so better go into any super market and buy 300rs bat."
429,1,Became defective in 2-3 days,"The racquet became defective only after 3-4 days of use. While it looked sturdy and battery life also looked good, but the product failed after 2-3 days of use. It is not getting enough charged to kill a mosquito. Waste of money! The unbranded ones earlier bought worked much better for me."
430,5,Good one but needs improvements,The bat is not sturdy. In one week the mesh expanded and I could feel some thing moving in the bat. Some plastic bit broke and the battery was moving up and down
431,2,"Not good, highly priced","I did not get the purpose of vertical blue light, cant see mosquitos with that. We can easily get this kind of racket in market for 100, 200 Rs. Quality is fine but no racket can be useful once battery life is over in few months."
432,1,Manufacturing defect. Bad product.,"Despite making several efforts warranty is not being registered by the company. Having functioned for a month, it started malfunctioning. By pressing the button, it sparks itself without coming into contact of any flying bug. Bad product. Better to buy offline atleast warranty is assured."
433,4,Best mosquito repellant in the market,"Excellent mosquito repellent available in the market. I have used other local market rackets. But non of them were anything near to this superb racket. Long lasting, sturdy, easy to use. I am going to order another one. Don't think just st go for it..."
434,1,Poor battery life.,Where mosquitoes are in abundance you can have it but for houses where 2-3 are there it‚Äôs better to switch to some other option. If you forgotten to put it in charging then it‚Äôs completely useless as daily charging us not possible.
435,5,Great product,Awesome product. Must buy. It is 100 times better than other products of its kind. It requires charge only once in two weeks and is very effective to use.
436,1,Bad Sturdiness and durability,The product was excellent but the main problem waa durability and sturdiness. When I bought it after few days of use it got some circuit failure and when I was switching it on the wire were getting burned and having short circuit. Amazon replaced it without but the 2nd time I got this it worked fine however afyer few days of use it stopped working and getting charged
437,1,Product is not good useless and irresponsible seller.,This is a horrible.product worked for just 10 days and stopped working. Kindly refund the money and take the.useless product. Do not buy from this seller as he did not reply for my email not able to contact the seller. I have six months warranty on this product even Amazon did not help me to contact the seller. Such a bad experience with this seller. Beware of this seller.
438,4,Good zapper needs better quality battery,"Very powerful zapper does the job, pity after 3 months the battery doesn't last more than 20 mins. I bought 2 rackets both have same battery life. Initially it would last long. No the battery quiet weak"
439,1,"Pathetic Product, Pathetic Customer Service.","Stopped Working in 2 months. Have written for Warranty repairs, but no revert from HIT. Pathetic Product & even more Pathetic Customer Service. Better to purchase local brand from some local store. Not worth to spend 450/- where locally available in 200/-."
440,5,Good bat from a good brand,I spend the same amount in market but get cheap Chinese bat before which didn't work more than 1 or 2 month and quality also not good .. but this bat is good in quality and battery backup also good and hit brand is also well known.. But it is also written Made in China.
441,5,Bought on 30th October. Charging for the first time now in Feb!,"First charge after 3 months, unbelievable stuff! After charging normal mosquito bats almost everyday, I looked at this bat and thought there is some unlimited source of energy in it. One of the best products I have bought on Amazon."
442,1,Stopped working within two weeks..,"HIT Anti Mosquito Racquet - Rechargeable Insect Killer Bat with LED, that I bought on 19.09.2020, from Amazon. Racquet worked well for one week and has stopped working (not charging). The warranty for the Racquet  is for 6 month. I Tried to call Godrej customer care number several times but it's not at all connecting 18002660007 and I visited to their  portal and tried to claim defect but there is no use.. I never expected this kind of service. Still awaiting for refund.."
443,1,The quality has become worst now,This was 3rd one I bought. The first one which I bought was good and the charge used to last long. The last 2 I bought was very poor. The charge don't lat for even 1 hour after hours of charging. I bought local racquet which I could get 2 in price of one. So guys don't waste your money and invest in cheaper one instead.
444,5,Good Product with Great Battery Life,Great Product compared to cheap plastic ones in the market. Only downside is the on off switch which you toggle up or down is a bit flimsy but i can live without it by using any sharp object to on & off. Work wise its great & kills all sorts of mosquitoes & flies.
445,1,DON'T Buy it! Very Pathetic Product.,"I bought this product almost a week ago. For the first 1-2 days it worked fine and then it stopped working. The warranty thing is so bogus. Don't buy it, do not go for the name. You better buy from the near local market for almost the half price of it. I can say that would work for at least 6 months as compared to this Godrej Hit Mosquito Raquet which did not work for even 6 days."
446,1,Overhype product,"Dint even last for a day may be defective product I received, but over all product quality is cheap you can buy the local brand for 250 that will be worth then this"
447,5,A much needed branded product in this category.,"I will start off by saying that the built quality is amazing. It feels solid and sturdy in your hand and one can swing it with confidence. It‚Äôs a bit costlier than other off brand products, but it‚Äôs justified. Looks nice also."
448,5,"Good product, good features","Good product, good features, good value for money. I am not sure if it is made in China. But much better than cheap Chinese ones."
449,4,Overall Great and Powerful,Pros- High Quality Plastic-Helpful in built charging socket- Very EffectiveCons- Sometimes the plastic is a bit hard to grip and slips out of hand-No in- built light ( They have a weird blue light which is placed very oddly pointing upwards. I don‚Äôt know why they chose blue LED
450,3,Not Durable,"In a nutshell, it could be concluded that it is much better as compared to other electric racquets available in market but durability is not appealing. Mine was damaged within couple of months."
451,5,Best of all other bats.,Very durable. Bought many of these. Unlike other bats which doesn‚Äôt work after a few months. A little bit costly but totally worth it because of the quality
452,1,It broke within 3-4 months of use,"Just when I thought my tennis skills were getting better, something inside the racquet's handle started rattling (I presume its the battery). Mind you, the racquet has never been subjected to any physical abuse (not in my knowledge anyways). Presently, I'm drinking juice (lost too much blood), while I listen to the mosquitoes' high frequency laughter as they hover around my ear."
453,5,Excellent product with manual operation,Racquet is strong and sturdy and works perfectly. The blue light is an advantage to use in nights but we have to manually hold the power button on to kill mosquitoes. If power gets on with blue light it would have been an excellent product to use automatically..
454,1,Good but poor battery backup!,Doesn't hold charge as much as expected from a brand like Godrej!
455,4,Good product,Good product but not sure how long it would last. So far killed ~300 mosquitoes with it. Neon light look cool but not sure if that attracts mosquitoes.
456,4,Battery Life is short but racket is effective.,The racket worked fine for killing mosquitos after full charge. Many times it looked like not working but after 1-2 days pause it started killing again. However after 7.5 months it is not working. Still it worked well for killing mosquitos without any pollution. Recommended product
457,5,This product is very much study and durable to use..,"This product is very much study and durable to use. If you want to really buy mosquito bat ,then despite of going to select Chinese bat you can surely rely on godrej product . Which is really made in india . Battery is really long lasting. Effectiveness is excellent against mosquito.The weight of this mosquito bat is also really light,so it becomes very much handy while using."
458,1,Warranty issue,Forget to register on godrej site. Basically I did not noticed about the warranty claim procedure. Now after 5 months the bat stopped working. Dont know what to do. Anybody please suggest.
459,1,Wastage of Money,"This is total wastage of your money. It stopped working on the 2 nd day of the usage. Plus you can't return or get the refund as there is no doorstep pickup for the item. And there warranty page doesn't work. Better go with a local product.Update - Thanks to Amazon i got my refund. Amazing work by Amazon team.Ps - Don't go for this product, you can't claim warranty as well."
460,1,Follow up of HIT company is pathetic.,Products performance was outstanding especially battery life but after 4 months suddenly racket stopped working.  I have called and message HIT company but no response till now. My 6 month product warranty is expired. Now hit racket is garbage for me.Starting experience was awesome but company support system is very disappointing.
461,5,Hit Anti Mosquito Racquet working well,Good product. Charging & discharging as  given in Hit product manual. Kills mosquitoes instantly.Blue light range not checked. Handy item to have
462,4,"Nice product, but bad charging plug design","Good product and effective. But it's tiresome to charge, as the plug is not of standard socket dimensions, and it there are chances of it falling off"
463,1,Very bad,Very  bad
464,1,Worst product,It is not working from second day onwards. Light is blinking but nothing happening to mosquitoes. Hit company nicely cheating the customers. So think twice before buying this product.
465,1,Not effective,It is not effective as compared with low cost variety available freely in the market. I could count the number of mosquitos killed on my finger tips with this gadget.
466,1,Very bad item. This hit anti mosquito racquet has become unserviceable right after 15 days.,"Very bad item. This hit anti mosquito racquet has become unserviceable right after 10days.  I was very much impressed with the brand name, I had a blind trust on the product. Now the L E D on it is working, but it doesn't kill any more mosquito. I am writing this review just after 15 days of purchase."
467,1,Good while receiving and bad after 5 months usage,"My first review:Good look and quality but not enough battery backup.After using 5 months review:It produce some sound like small motor start, while press the button. Also it's sound is increasing, if press longer."
468,4,Good one to buy,"Good quality product. Working well, battery long lasting . Received as shown in the picture Cons:  Charging plug attached to racquet sometimes it may fall from the switch board keep the racquet above the table or bed while charging ...they could have provided like plug with wire extension."
469,4,Good product recommended,Good product i recomand this product. Battery will serve 2 to 3 days. Used materials are good but design is not perfect after we can find cracking sounds and small moments on body. But product is excellent it will kill mosquitoes perfectly. Provided night light is not effective. Bat is made in china don't expect for loges life.
470,1,Premium chinese product,"Very bad product. Within 6 months product doesn't kill mosquito anymore. It killed itself. Premium chinese product,waste of money"
471,2,DON'T BUY.,"NOT WORTHLESS...it us useless after using 1 month ..and after claiming warranty NO RESPONSE is coming from godrej company...So,DON'T BUY this product.... waste of money...i purchased 3 tmes..everytime its stop working after 1,2 months...."
472,4,Amazing product,This is just an initial review based on usage for a week.Pros-Very good build quality.The charging pins are strong to keep the Racquet stable while charging.Emits blue light when switched on which attracts mosquitoes.Cons-Very slightly heavy.
473,2,Waste,"Not at all value for money.. LED is simply useless, cant be used to spot mosquitoes in the dark since it throws light on the face of racquet.. the LED opening throws light upwards, not outwards..."
474,4,Works well but slightly costly,Been using it since last two months and it works well to get rid of pesky mosquitos. Has bluelight to see these buggers at night too. Overall a good buy but slightly costly
475,4,Good,"It is a good mosquito killer racquet, very powerful.  I had to return the first one that I received as it was faulty.  Replacement is working fine."
476,3,"Its costly, you find this in local markets half the price","Bought in Feb 2020 and battery gone dead in august 2021.  Plastic quality is good but pricewise i felt it costly.  Better to buy in local market, you will get this item half the price there.  Forget about the brand all works the same, this bat is just branded with hit to the chinese local bat."
477,1,Poor after sale service from Amazon,We received damaged and defective product. Racket battery is not working .Applied for return same day  of receiving the product. It's been more thn 10 days chasing Amazon. No response from Amazon.
478,5,Value for money,"If u are looking for a mosquito racket, buy this one. It looks good, its durable only if u don't drop it. These rackets are very delicate so handle it carefully and it comes with 6 month warranty too."
479,2,6m Warranty window show error,"2stars only. Because of false claims by the company, at first why the customer has to register on their site, warranty should come with the pdt. Moreover, the warranty window shows an error while submitting the request, simply unacceptable."
480,5,"SHOULD BUY, NOT KIDDING!","Very very very effective. I'm still surprised that why is HIT selling in such cheap price. I kid you not, if you desperately need a mosquito bat then this is it. WOW. Charge it daily for 8 hours if there are a lot of mosquitoes. It's so powerful. Can't believe I'm sleeping daily with such peace because of this."
481,5,Good product,Good product. I am using it for more than 2-3 months. Battery life is good. Mostly the working capability of this racquet is far better than the china products. I found it really nice. But the body material is not upto the mark. The side of the racquet is already broken after got a hit in the corner of a table.
482,4,Best bat ever,"I love this bat. It has durability and unlike other bats I have bought this one's charging plug didn't break, But I have seen some bats with a higher battery life than this"
483,1,Not Worth it.,For a price of 450 it's not worth it. You drop it 3-4 times and the battery becomes loose due to structural damage from inside so yes it's not strong(def. Not Aircraft plastic) and the battery life too is bad it gets totally discharged after 2-3hrs or usage. Don't buy it there are lots of good Bats available in Local Store.
484,1,Stopped working after 2months.,Was atleast expecting more time when we spend twice the money. But this bat gave up in 2 months. 200rs electric bat works atleast for a yr. Dont purchase this
485,4,Very good quality bat,"This is branded , very good quality mosquito bag with several other options. It‚Äôs effective on mosquitos. Flies, insects etc. definitely recommend"
486,3,Disappointed with this Hit product,"Very disappointed with this branded Hit product..battery life is so bad that after killing few mosquitoes during the day, by night battery is out..forget flies it does not even capture small mosquitoes, very bad experience after using for just one week..now don't have a choice but to order a new one.Would never recommend this product, think twice before ordering."
487,1,Worst Product with the Brand!!!,Product got delivered on 4th January and not even used for 2 weeks and Bat has stopped working...I can only see charging light but when trying to use then there is no effect üò°There is no physical damage or anything but still it's not working....China made Bat has more durability than this product. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT....TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY ü§¨
488,4,Branded Mosquito bat,"Branded Mosquito bat working fine.  But inner parts are moving, but performance of bat is o.k. I thing battery moving when up and down the battery"
489,4,Overall rating - 7/10,Product is okay.Handling - 7/10Light weight. Very Fragile - 7/10LED - 2/10 is just a show piece. Doesnot serve purpose.Finish - 7/10Charging - 4-6 hrs
490,5,Nice Product.,"I read previous reviews that the battery backup was not good, It has lasted me for 1.5 months after 1 single charge.I hope the battery backup works the same way in future as well.Nice product, Works as expected, Just hope it lasts for a long time."
491,3,MADE  IN CHINA,"Claims to be made in India on answered questions on product description page, but on the carton it's printed that the country of origin is China and the manufacturing month is 09-2021"
492,1,Defective product,Opened and defective product
493,1,Bad quality defective product,The product broke down within 15 days with one day of good use outdoors for about 15 minutes. The battery was loose and was rattling inside the handle.
494,1,Bad quality.  Used product sent as new. Returned. AVOID!,Bad quality.  Used product sent as new.  Mesh zaps on its own soon as it's turned on.  Had to return.
495,1,"Do not buy, better buy from a local store","The product is severely damaged.AC adaptor plug is broken and rattling inside.Has a burnt plastic and mesh in the middle of racket.Product is packed in such a way that it's invincible, just the box and cheap plastic wrapped and not even completely.I really blame cloudtail's service.Please double-check while buying from cloudtail."
496,2,Faulty item,"Became faulty on 20th day after delivery, coudnt return the product, the warranty registration didnt work. Currently its unusable product lying here. Dont know how it got faulty."
497,1,Never even turns on,The bats nets are damaged and also the lights are not even working after plugged in to charge. Seems like poor battery or over all poor product and this is the second time I‚Äôm getting a damaged product.
498,2,"Initially it was good, but went bad after 2-3 months","Initially it was very good but after 2-3 months of use (which I used very rarely), some cross connection happened within its wire and whenever I switch it ON, it will spark upon itself. Hence, the racquet has reduced its efficiency now, in entrapping mosquitoes within its mesh work."
499,5,Good one,"The difference between this bat and the Chinese one is the battery. It has high ampere battery, but the Chinese doesn't. That's why the price difference."
500,1,Unable to register for warranty. Device Stopped Working,####Must Read####**Cons**Unable to register for warranty on the site and even after multiple requests to customer care via email. Not even an acknowledgement response. Eventually the device Stopped working after 3 months of usage. Unable to claim warranty. Worst costumer service.*Pros**Good battery life.
501,2,Not worth if it doesn't do the work it is made for,The design is so stringent that the mosquito doesn't get inside. You just can't wave it to kill the mosquito rather you will have to find the mosquito and then hit. please don't buy thinking of the giant manufacturer'hit'. The local one is much better. I had to Ultimately return the product.
502,1,Battery not getting charged within 9 months of usage,"It was good till now but now after 9 months of usage, the battery is not getting charged and this has become useless. The cost paid for this doesn't justify the buy."
503,1,"Product Not working, upset with Brand like HIT to have sent such a product.",We have received a used product. With seal opened and wrapped with cling wrap.Product is not working. Totally unhappy with Hit for such a sub standard product
504,5,Sturdy product with excellent battery life,"Have been using this racquet for 2.5 months, almost daily. The battery life is excellent and lasts around 3 to 4 weeks on a single charge. The material used is great. I have dropped the racquet a few times and so far there is no damage to the product."
505,2,Not durable,I am writing this review after using the product for a little more than a year.. it has stopped working and I would not give this a great rating for its price..Not worth it.
506,1,"Very poor quality, broke down in a month.have complained on the hit website but no response at all..","Very poor quality, broke down in a month.have complained on the hit website but no response at all.."
507,5,Best Branded Mosquito Racquet ever..,Best Mosquito Racquet till date...Durability of plastic is amazing.And little LED light helps you to find the Mosquito in the dark and has 100% success rate.A little bit pricy but we can spend on such a brand which has good reputation against malaria and dengue fever.We really need this.
508,5,Only thing that works on mosquitoes,The racquet is pretty powerful and sturdy. It has a strong built and impressive power to kill mosquitoes.However not sure why they put a blue led light. It doesn't help much in the dark to find mosquitoes. Still overall pretty impressive and good product
509,1,Stopped working within 4-5 Days.,I think product was not worst..But I have received faulty product.Sealed (Security Seal) was opened when the product received.Stopped working within 4-5 Days.Thanks to Amazon for managing return.
510,5,"If you are in Delhi NCR, go for it",A must have product for almost every home if there is mosquito there. Using it since 6 months and it's too good to buy. Battery life is super.
511,1,Stopped working within a month,"The mosquito bat seemed good at first but later it was not able to hold the charge. I never overcharged it, yet it stopped working in a month. We get better durable mosquito bats on roadside at much cheaper rates than this. Don't waste money on this."
512,1,Better to buy the 150/- racket,I bought two of these expensive rackets thinking it is from a reputed company and would hopefully last longer than the Rs150/- local rackets. Unfortunately even this racket also conked off in about 6 months. Infact my other racaket of 150/- lasted longer. Not recommended to buy from my side
513,1,Inferior chinese product,Don't buy this mosquito killing bat...Charging slider get stuck during charging.It doesn't slide easily.. Customer support won't listen anything about it...It is simply waste of our money...Please please don't buy it...
514,2,It‚Äôs good for 4 months and blasted while charging . Need to buy new one now üò°,It‚Äôs good for 4 months and then blasted while charging . Need to buy new one now üò°
515,5,3 month usage review,"1: sturdy. Doesn't slip from the charging socket2: charge lasts for 1 full week. (30-60 min usage / day)3: kills mosquitoes instantly.I haven't dropped the device yet, so dont know the ruggedness.Satisfied with the product"
516,1,Very bad product and advised not to buy,"Item was sold by Amazon seller ""Cloudtail"". Item is not working after two weeks (return policy was over). Registered for warranty on Godrejhit site and also claimed for warranty. But, there is no reply from Godrej (manufacturer). I have called on their tollfree number many (1800 266 0007) times, but no answer. Hence, it is considered as a very bad product and no product support. It is advised not to buy this product."
517,1,The worst Supplier! Faulty Product!,Amazon has delivered the faulty product. Full of scratches over the product. A loosened sound is coming from the product. After delivery within 10min I have applied for return. Almost 2 weeks overed. Till now return not yet initiated. I couldnt find zero rating. Otherwise definitely I would have given zero rating.
518,1,Good one,Worth buying. Will post review after using it for month.
519,3,Not built to last more than 6-7 months,"I think they have made a product which does not last more than a couple of months after their warranty expired. The one I bought stopped working after almost 8 months of use.Thanks to the inefficiency of the municipal corporations in controlling the mosquitoes and failure to cover all drains, we end up buying one after the other."
520,1,Reduced size and quality as compared to previous year product,"As this product  is successful , so to make profit company has reduced the overall sizee by 20 percent and plastic and buttone quality is downgraded to make profit. Reducing star to 1 .Oncee the product is successful now xompanyy making profits by reducingt quality . This is not Ethical ."
521,1,Gone damage and working with in 7 month.,After 7 month normal use this racket is not working now. It's like a normal 200‚Çπ racket not any specific and durable. Only brand name nothing else.
522,1,Bad Product,When we got the product it felt very nice quality wise and it lasted for 4 days almost without any charge.Post that real problem started no matter how many hours or days we kept this on charging it doesn‚Äôt last for more than 5 min !!Very very bad. Don‚Äôt buy this !!
523,4,Hit from China,"Product is good, though sold by Godrej under HiT BRAND. It is made in china Product sold by Godrej. Disappointed large conglomerate like Godrej could have made this in India"
524,1,Non existent battery life !,Battery hardly lasts for few minutes  even after an entire night of charging... useless product.. even the Chinese ones r 100 times better!
525,3,"Works well to zap bugs, but rattling noises from inside in just 6 months of usage.",It does its job just fine.But literally just 6 months into usage and the insides of the racket are already starting to rattle heavily.
526,5,Must go for it...,"It an amazing product, superb quality and build, batter last very long under moderate use which is sufficiently enough for common households... i have charged it may 4 times since I have bought this..."
527,1,Stopped working,"It worked only for a week.  Nothing is working even after charging.  Submitted the claim status and i got a response that the customer care rep will be contacting me.  No one contacted till date.I called to the given customer care number multiple times but was not able to talk to any person, it always disconnects."
528,4,Good sturdy bat,"It‚Äôs a sturdy, well designed and adequately powered Bat, ideal for home use. It zaps the mosquitoes with a single power stroke but to truly kill them keep the button pressed for a few seconds."
529,5,Its good product,It is very durable it have blue light But battery life is 4star but in this price it is overall good product
530,5,Good and Durable,"Good product and durable. I am using product from last 8 months, it is good having long battery life, battery recharged with in few hours.Don't look to negative reviews just go for it.."
531,1,Don't Buy this Product,"May be this product is from a renowned company ""Godrej"", but I recommend people not to go for this product. This product even comes with a complimentary fake tag of ""6 months warranty"". After 1month the racquet isn't working, neither its flashing nor its killing mosquitoes, instead to it being fully charged. When I reached the company for the warranty, it didn't response. This is really disappointing."
532,2,"After 11 months, switch not working",The Mesh area is very small. 11 months after purchase the switch is not working. Don't know where to get it repaired. Its use less now. 11 months is too less for Rs. 500
533,2,Replacement received immediately and the product is very good,"Got this damaged product with a broken switch, so returned it for replacement and i the seller send me a good working bat, which i have been using for some time, and its the best mosquito bat i have used till now, very happy with the product finally"
534,1,Very cheap quality product...it's seems a Chinese product..,It‚Äôs my humble request that don‚Äôt buy this product. I have requested to return this item as it was malfunctioned from day 1. Amazon has assured me the return of the product..Since then country wide lock down is going on. No status from Amazon now ...Even I have registered a complaint to Godrej company also but nothing has been done. My money has gone now.
535,5,Excellent quality. Good build.,I would recommend this mosquito bat over any other similar product available on amazon. It has the right quality and it works really well. I love the blue light mode!
536,3,Could have been USB charging.,"Instead of using cheap capacitor AC charging which is prone to break, this could  have used Micro USB or Type-C charging as used by Nippo."
537,5,Head design is definitely innovative,Flat head with a groove for corners is definitely a useful design innovation. Will take indian mosquitos 20-30 generations of mutations to figure out how to escape now ... that means it will work well for 1-2 more seasons of dengue
538,1,register for warranty,"This racket is useless. I believed in Amazon review and grading shown in your display. On talking to consumer service of Godrej SIT, they advised me to ask for registration and warranty. I did not see any such feature in your mail or invoice. I want to return this racket and get refund or some other model of racket for killing mosquitos.......S.K.Karande"
539,1,Big disappointmentüëéüèº,"Very poor performance, I thought HIT being a reputable brand will have a good, effective product but thoroughly disappointed. You take it so close to flies and nothing happens, they just fly away flapping their wings!  Would like to return but have thrown away the packaging."
540,3,Reliability unpredictable,The first piece stopped working in a week's time. It would charge but not work. Thankfully I'd registered it on the site so I could claim warranty. The replacement was done in a week's time. The second piece has been working ok for the past 1week or so. Not sure of its life.
541,1,DISASTER,"ORIGINAL SEAL WAS BROKEN. ORIGINAL PACKAGING MISSING (WAS ONLY BUBBLE WRAPPED).100% USED AND NON WORKING RETURNED PIECE DELIVERED BY RESELLER CLOUDTAIL.OPEN LOOT BY BOTH CLOUDTAIL AND AMAZON.IF THEY ARE SO DESPARATE FOR MAKING MONEY THEY SHOULD TRY SOME OTHER AVENUES, PLENTY OF OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TODAY."
542,1,Worthless product,"Useless product .Battery is hopeless.charge not retained.Mosquitos fly through the gap in the bat. With this product company has lost the goodwill of the other product.Please don't buy, don't fall in thair trap."
543,1,Awful,It does not work even when the mosquito is trapped inside the mesh.....It is that awful.  realised it after the return window closing time
544,1,Purpose of buy not served! Waste,"First delivered damaged product and I replaced item, 2nd time delivered product is not functioning. I hit many mosquitoes but non of them died. They are passing through them. Its waste product. I returned this item."
545,4,Go for it it's awesome.,Very good product only prob is battery prob and that too because it works when battery shorts (to electrocute mosquitoes). May be they could have used bigger battery even though it's value for money.Totally worth it.
546,2,Bad product,Battery good for less than 6 months only. They have used a substandard battery which was leaking inside. Very pathetic product from Godrej which we proudly associate as a Indian MNCüëé
547,1,Received damaged product,Product I received in damage condition. There is some circuits issue once you press the button it start giving shock in its mesh..I repaired it myself
548,3,Lot of improvement required,Average product like others little disappointed as this represent company called hit lot of scope to improve specially  operating buttons
549,4,Great but lacks good battery backup,Works great. Only problem is that the battery lasts about 1~2 hours max if you are frequently using it. Also the blue light it has isn‚Äôt helpful at all. I have no clue what‚Äôs it‚Äôs purpose because you certainly can‚Äôt see the mosquitoes with it
550,1,CHEAP CHINESE PRODUCT.,Cheap quantity Chinese product.... using it carefully but damaged with in 3 months ..really disappoint.‚òπÔ∏èüòû
551,4,Weak product,It is meantvtonkill flying insects.. ok.. but it has failed after one week with the outer/ inner got shorted . Not to buy this product . Buy the Chinese variety
552,1,Worst product,"This is totally waste product for me! As I had purchased recently following the brand and (Amazon Choice) but within a month it stopped working..  despite of charging it does'nt work.. As per the warranty policy i tried calling to 18002660007 i.e the tollfree number of Hit for warranty claim and regarding any issue, but unfortunately they did'nt show any response even i had mail. so i would like to request all the customers think before you purchase!  Rs 499 is too much for this cheap quality.."
553,3,Build quality should have been more solid and stronger,"Product is small and fits better in hand. Battery life is quite good as product is in its starting days will update it later. But major concern of the product is its poor build quality, it feels very fragile and feels like it would break easily if collided with any solid  obstacles better handle with added care."
554,5,WORTH IT,"Buy it any day! After all, there are no branded rackets. And as it says, the material used in of really high quality. It is actually nice and makes a get away from mosquitos!"
555,3,"Chinese product, alas!","Decent product, well made, and kills mosquitos very efficiently. Charged for 4 hrs the first time. This is a Godrej product, but manufactured in China. Was misled about this seeing the Godrej label. See picture for details."
556,4,Good product by hit. But needs improvement in light.,Battery life is good. Easily lasts for 5-6 days for normal usage.I didn't like it light. It is of no use. They could have put white light.
557,1,Skip this. Doesn't work and Made in China,It's not able to do its basic task of killing the mosquitoes. They are passing through the mesh without any issues. Seems they are enjoying it. Have initiated return. Will go buy something from a local shop.  Another worst part is it's Made in China.
558,5,Nice product,"After searching so much online and seeing at reviews, i finally decided to go wit this. It's really an amazing product. Have been using since couple of months, don't see any issues. Go for it."
559,4,Product that needs improvement,"It is a good product, however, its durability is around 6 months, the warrantee replacement does not last beyond 3 months. The manufacturer has to improve the design keeping in mind the points"
560,1,Waste of time and money,"I purchased on 16th May 2021 n today its 17th August 2021 the bat s not working, within 3 months this s the condition..... I want an immediate call from Amazon team"
561,5,Exterminate and get rid of mosquitos with this bat,"Fantastic, effective, great, useful. What more can one say. At last we can sit in our garden and have tea. This is the solution to many a woe of mosquito stings and nuisance."
562,2,Pathetic Battery Backup,"Even at full charging it doesn't stand more than an HR of use....As per description, it says it sud work for a month but it didn't want even stand for a day....Very sad about battery back up."
563,1,Worked for just 3 months,"Stopped working after 3 months. Wasn't charging, the mosquitoes started setting up picnics on it.So, it didn't even kill 1/10th the mosquitoes of its cost. Just buy a cheaper one, and save yourself the regret. Unless you like an ugly looking, good for nothing, showpiece in your house, then sure you can buy this."
564,2,beware of seller.,"Product is good but cloudtail seller is not good. earlier, cloudtail was reliable but now this time, seller is giving used product. i got used product but as it was working fine so i did not return. but this is very bad practice to give used product instead of new one."
565,5,COSTLY BUT QUALITY PRODUCT : RECOMMENDED,The mosquito racket is a quality product. After all that is what I expected from HIT. Though it is little costlier than others in the market but noone would regret after receiving the product. Battery life is good. A single charge continue for 5-6 days. Ergonomic grip. It genuinely stand out from the crowd.
566,5,Very good quality. Go for it,Best in market. Branded and comes with 6 months warranty too. Havd been using it for almost 5 months now. Go for it without any doubts.
567,5,Battery problem ! (But they a brand new replacement product),UPDATE 27JUL2021I claimed brand warrant (after 25 days of receiving the product.  (Amazon Return was closed)Within JUST 2 DAYS i received a brand new replacement product from Godrej / Seller.  Thank you so much.
568,4,Works as described. wish the battery pack in the racket handle could be charged separately.,"Works as described. Nice product but wish the battery pack in the racket handle could be charged separately.As of now, two retractable charging electric pins are joined to the racket so the whole racket has to be placed at the charging socket."
569,5,Good product,"So it‚Äôs a well made sturdy product, well designed, It has a small blue UV led on it. The trick is to use the light is to keep the racket on the table or wall with the light on and the mosquitoes get attracted to the light and then you can buzz them!! Remember if your home lighting is too bright then it won‚Äôt work."
570,4,Better than the Cheaper Options,This mosquito killer is ten times better than those available in the market in Rs 100.Good battery life and study build.
571,1,Bad product,Went kaput in just 3 months of usage... Electric board inside is of bad quality... Wiring also was not very good... Totally a bad product for the high price
572,2,Battery dying just after 6 months,"Six month warranty just ended and now the battery is almost useless. Charge it for the whole day, it won't even last one night's use."
573,5,Best Mosquito Racket!,It works fine but make sure it works very well within 7 days of replacement. 1 of my rackets didn't work so I had to return it. Money was refunded already
574,5,Great Anti-mosquito Racquet,"I have been using this for nearly 6 months now. Everything about this racquet is great. You can directly plug it in the power outlet at a certain height. The product is a complete value for money in terms of battery life, sturdiness & durability."
575,5,Good value for money,"I have been using this racquet for more than a month now and I have found it to be working as expected, is fairly sturdy and have not had to charge it at all so far. I would recommend to go for it without a doubt."
576,5,Good,Its good product.. only issue you will face after long term use will be of charging fangs.. so take care of those two fangs.. otherwise everything is good.. good life.. üëç
577,1,Most pathetic product Pl don‚Äôt Buy,It has conked off in less than 6 months with hardly any usage . Other cheaper products I bought earlier used to work for at least a year or so but this one with hardly any usage has stopped working
578,1,poor quality. must be replaced,Battery is weak. Product is poor in quality and the part inside the racket becomes so loose or get disjointed that they start moving from one end to the other. It's looses it's effectiveness and fails to kill mosquito
579,1,Dont Buy,"This product plug is not that great, it will easily become non functional.I have bought this product two times but same problem.Now am not even able to return this product.WASTE OF MONEY."
580,2,PLEASE DONT BUY,"I am reviewing after more than 15 days of use...Though the built quality is good but the battery is very bad...The company is misleading the customers by saying that it lasts upto 1 month after full charge but the reality is ,after 4-5 hours of charge the battery only lasts for hardly upto 3 hrs."
581,3,Average product with high price,"Strong built, durable battery but performance is not good. U can get better product from local shop at better price and with greater performance"
582,4,Worth of its price.,"Using from past 4 months and feltsome rich feeling while using it. Its worth of money we put. Plastic is less weight and seems delicate. Battery is good, runs for 2 to 7 days for a full charge. It would be better if they gave removable battery or recharge with wire. Torch is very dull. Finally it's good for killing mosquitos."
583,5,Battery lasts way too longer!!,"It actually is a good product to get rid of the stubborn mosquitoes. Abd the battery life is also good like if you charge it once then it will last for at least 4-5 days, so yea go for it."
584,5,Battery Life And Killing Power,I give 5 start for this because it's work as mentioned in product details but the one point is useless the LED light on this don't have any use because the light set in that position that doesn't work well also battery life is too good because I charge it once time and use 5 days without charging and use more too so battery life so awesome
585,5,Battery backup is really nice and works well,"Battery backup is really nice and works well even after many monthsthis is my second purchase, the previous one is still working"
586,5,Works fine,"There was initially some issue with the battery, contacted customer care, and they have replaced with a new product, hassle free! Have been using it for 4 months, no issues after that. All the other brands (Chinese) will be of similar quality, but not provide any replacement guarantee."
587,4,Nice & Durable product,"Nice but charging pins are not exact to fit in socket, its loose and due to this many times fall from sockets and may damage. need to modify charging design."
588,1,Not worth 500...go for weird wolf as it much more durable and long lasting,Don't fall for the six months warranty. Mine worked fine for a couple of months and the suddenly stopped one day. I have been trying to reach the customer care via email and call but no one is responding.
589,5,V sturdy & good quality compared to chinese cheap ones,V sturdy & good quality compared to chinese cheap ones. Battery lasts v long. I only have to charge twice in last 2 months of purchase
590,4,Good quality product,Battery life is good ...Good quality product... ordered few before as well for family...one had issue but immediately under warranty I got replacement. very quick response ....I will order more for my office
591,3,It should have some more advanced feature like The other bats around like the automatic mode,Ok product it should have some advanced features like automatic mode so we keep the bat on the stand with the Ir led light ON and it keeps on killing the mosquitoes comes near the racket
592,1,Not that good,"Waste product, it seems like it has no power. Mosquitos got only shock they wont die. Few healthy one gonna fly again ü§£"
593,2,Dissatisfied for the Second time purchase,This is my second time purchase. The battery was not charging. I request a replacement. Now this replaced one won't kill mosquitoes. The circuit inside was not fixed. Was not happy. So returned it.But I was happy when I bought it first time. It worked  well.
594,1,Used and non-functional product delivered,It doesn't charge. Seal's broken. Bubble wrap is deflated completely. Clearly used as mosquitoes are stuck all over the netting.
595,4,Great customer service,"This is my second review , my mosquito racquet stopped working after two months and I have claimed for warranty and the company replaced it within a month am so happy with the customer service."
596,5,Sturdy and effective,"Not 100% effective tho, cuz sometimes mosquitos pass through, but works well mostly. Feels durable at hand and battery is good, good."
597,1,Product stopped working & no response from customer care of godrej for claiming warranty,Please don't buy this product this is not even worth 150rs I bought it for 499rs because of the warranty after using this product for 15 days the mesh got enlarged & racquet stopped working when I applied to claim the warranty the customer care people were not responding I think this is completely fake please don't buy this product
598,4,No registration for warranty,"It works nicely but I tried many times to register its warranty. Their site never works. So basically you can buy it on your own risk. If it works, it works nicely. And if not than sorry for the inconvenience."
599,5,Amazing product,"Just an Amazing product, I took this product in January and it's been 2months, since then I had only charged once (6Hrs initially)I use it atleast 10mins in a day and even now, it has the same battery strength like earlier.It's a must preferred product for whoever  hates mosquitos üôÇ"
600,1,Not worth for money,I bought this on August month and now It stopped working... waste of money I trusted the HIT but it's not the trusty worthy product guys....Update: Two day's back of this review I raised query for the replacement of the product in the HIT website as this product is having the 6months warranty we will see how they are going to respond or not...
601,2,Below expectations in terms of durability.,"I used it rarely, like once or twice in a week. That too for a short time (<5min). The bat worked well for about 4 months. After that it had various problems (such as low power). By 6 months it was mostly useless."
602,5,The best among all,"Very sturdy but very light and hence very comfortable.  Among all the ones I used for so many years, this is the best. GO FOR IT"
603,5,does what it should,"what more to say? it does was it should, the blue LED  isn't really helpful, but at this price point it's charge does last long"
604,1,Non authentic,"Amazon delivered it in just 1day but for return it's been over 5 days but no update from them. Faulty item, no clear manual doest seems to be genuine"
605,1,"Bigger,better, stronger made in China product","Racquet looks made with very good quality plastic. It is made in China and imported by Godrej product. Advantage you have is warranty. So don't forget to apply for warranty within 10 days of purchase. You must upload JPG file of your invoice so don't try to use PDF invoice provided by Amazon directly, convert it into JPG before upload"
606,1,China product with indian name,"It a China product.Godraj is cheating indian people putting Indian brand name.Make in india then sell.Its a breach of faith.Even mosquito bats can't made godraje ,what the realibility of godraj products.I think indian companies forget making .They are looking imports from China cheap products instead of making.very very disapointeds"
607,5,Quality product value for money,Very good quality and comes with 6 month warranty much better than the market Chineseodeos which do not part long.Go for this you might be paying 100 to 150 more but it's worth it
608,4,Good product,"One of the best anti mosquito racket purchased till date, very effective. Only one that comes with 6 month warranty.Battery life could have been better.Worth the extra money for sure."
609,4,Value for money @499/-,"It is value for money product @499/- with 6months warranty, better than Chinese bats which has no warranty and spoils anytime."
610,3,Does not last more than a season,"The product quality looks better than some other racquets in the market; however, it does not last more than one season. The buttons stopped working with one year; which is what happens with most other racquets. Thus, there is no point in paying extra for this racquet."
611,5,"Worth to buy, good product.","Extremely super product, i have little doubt while purchase, how to work and what is life and some other doubts, after purchased i am fully satisfied. Good product, worth to buy"
612,4,Effective Tool!,Battery life is OK. It retains charge for more than a week.Charging indicator should go off once the battery is fully charged.It is functional for all flying insect.
613,5,One of the best!,"Living in a mosquito prone area and having used several bats I find this to be one of the most sturdy, effective one. Go for it"
614,1,Short Lived,The product stopped working in 12 days. Unfortunately Amazon's return window just closed a day before and the period to register for warranty was also to be done within 10 days only.So much for durability of a product that claims to provide 6 month warranty huh!! Such a waste of money.
615,4,Don't like the product because of made in chaina,Product good and working good but only the problem made in chaina.. I like only made in india.
616,1,Short working life !!,The product worked well for 2-3 months and stopped after that. I keep charging the bat however the indicator does not turn green or show that the charging is full. Its really not worth it if the product does not even last a year.
617,1,Waste of money,Bought two and they stopped working in two months . Charging but wouldn't work at all. Waited long for warranty guys to reach back since one was under warranty period but . Not worth the price and no better than what one you would get on the road side half the price.
618,5,Sturdy and Durable,Been using this over 2 years now and its working perfectly and has withstood some good abuses. Little expensive than the usual unbranded ones but its durability makes it worth the price!
619,5,HIT Mosquito Bat,Fantastic product of international standard. Very effective and eliminates even non-visible mosquitoes like magic crackling continuously like dewali crackers. It has a strong battery requiring very less frequent recharging and the perfect design.
620,5,Best Mosquito Racquet used so far,Really like the product since it has a good battery life and is working fine after a couple of accidental drops. Very sturdy and nice finishing.
621,5,"Go for it, no doubt","Battery life is really good, not upto as mentioned in description but it serves the purpose. It is much much better option if compare to chinese products which were available till now."
622,3,Worked exactly for a year,Worked exactly for one year. The DMART version also survives one year at half the price. Godrej needs to justify the higher price.
623,5,A must buy,Its a must buy for any house. Excellent quality and sturdy.  One time purchase and i think it will be useful for long time. Using it since 6 months.
624,1,Poor Customer care and NO WARRANTY GIVEN BY GODREJ,"I have purchased this product from Amazon on Feb-20. But presently even after charging the product is not working properly. When I visit Godrej portal for my warranty, no response receive from them. After 7 days when I am checking my warranty status its showing ""Claimed"" (see image attached). I have neither received any phone calls or no one attended product query."
625,2,Not worth buying,"Ordered this racquet, have to put in lots of efforts just to catch one mosquito.Not sure if the product I received is a defective one or thats the expected outcome of this racquet.Even if I bring it close to the mosquitos, it doesn't catch it."
626,1,Durability in minus bit yhw option is not there.,Worst product as compared to out side local brand or unbranded. No service. No support. Also bat life time is just warranty time. Once time end bay goes end. Very fragile
627,1,Bad,Don't buy this.  This stopped working in 20 days and no one is replacing it. Warranty for this is a farce . Useless product
628,1,Worst product,"Stopped working 2days after the return period. Don't buy. Waste product. Have to throw it., I have enquired about it from their own people and they have advised not to buy it.  i could not even register the warranty as the site will not accept it.  I even sent mails which were not replied.  please do not buy this product"
629,1,Worst product ever bought,After charging for second time it stopped working completely only after one month of service .... When connected into socket it shows charging but will nit work after charging.Useless product.Still in warranty but diesnt work at all
630,3,Worked well but not charging after a week's use,"Product was working well, has good design, reaches well into corners, has led lights but after a week it stopped getting charged."
631,5,Buy it if you don't have soft corner for mosquitoes! Because this bat does what it is designed for.,"Good product. Kills mosquitoes, fruit flies as promised. Easy to use. In fact has blue colour light to attract flies. I have not found any issues till now and not even recharge also. It's still working on the charge as I received this product."
632,1,Worst product,Battery gone after 1 week.Led glows during charging but not working even after charging more than 2 hours.You have to register for warranty within 10 days of purchase.You cannot claim warranty or visit service center as there is no way to contact customer care...Please don't buy these products online..
633,1,Failed to work within a month,"This failed to work even for one month,can't contact the customer care and can't return it back.It charges but doesn't turn on.Seriously a money waster nothing more."
634,1,Tampered item received,"It would actually be wrong to rate low to Hit bat as such. We had ordered this previously and that was good. But this time, we received it in a tampered box without seal. The bat was also faulty without a cellotape so had to return the item. I hope Amazon looks into the matter and delivery systems."
635,1,Broken stuff gets delivered,If only i could give rating in negative i would have done that. The product was broken and didnt work even for a nano second.
636,2,Not so good,Not able to use it for more mosquitoes...
637,5,Styrdy vfm,Made in india. Best in class for this make so far for..e. very sturdy. It gives a better charging pin rather than cheep Chinese bats.
638,1,Item defective,"Few months ago I bought the product which was working nicely.So I recommended to my friend and bought again.but the item was defective.. eventhough it charged for long hour,but doesn‚Äôt lasting for an hour properly... it drained quickly. Waste of money."
639,5,Very very useful,"The price of the product may be almost twice than the available mosquito rackets in local market, but it is really worthy. The product is genuinely superb. Worth buying it."
640,1,Defective piece,Defective piece hai. Battery loose aayi thi. Wire tuta hua tha andar se white wala.Khol ke sahi kiya tab use kiya..
641,4,Battery 's Performance,"The battery power is not good when it is charged  continuously for 3 hours. In fact, when it is used for 1 week, it's intensity to kill the mosquito decreases. So, the brand should work in its battery's performance so that  when at once, it is charged for 3-4 hours, then it could be used for 1 month. Thank you"
642,1,defective product,"Defective product. It's not working on mode -2 i.e., killing mosquitoes in dark. Also the package is not intact and completely damaged(the actual cardboard case for the racket). Seems like Amazon is trying to sell the defective product which was already returned by someone"
643,1,"It's not good, has stopped making nois","It's not good, has stopped making noise when contacted with mosquito and so its difficult to know whether it's working or not"
644,1,Not nice product,"Better for  2months,After two months  this product  not survive,I replaced  3times but same problem  issue  after 1.5 to 2 months,Problem  is low sparking,mosquito doesn't dead"
645,5,Useful and fun,The best mosquito bat that I ever used. Close your eyes and go for this.Useful and fun to use this most of the times.
646,5,1 year with couple of falls and no problems at all,This product is on the expensive side but is nice. It fell couple of times but still working properly.It's almost 1 year with no problems.
647,1,Fraud bat,"The product is worth 0.5 stars. It worked for less than 1 month. Even the junk bats available in market work more than a month. Don't fall for the brand and warranty. Neither th toll free no nor thr email work. This is fraud bat. Bought the bat from reliance mart, even the mart will not help you."
648,5,100% original,Its a good product i purchase this product for son due to mosquito ü¶ü and when i started to using this product i feel that from black hit company provide us very good products.
649,1,Extremely poor product from HIT,Very poor product for the price. Battery life in not as claimed by the company. Barely worked for 2 months. Then suddenly stopped working. Warranty has to be settled with manufacturer. Amazon provides no assistance.Advised not to buy or to buy offline from merchant shops who can be approached for warranty settlement.
650,3,LED light didn't work from beginning and bat also didn't work,"I had received a defective product from the seller, I doubt it to be a duplicate product. LED light wasn't working, bat didn't function after using it for few days.I had raised the warranty in HIT website, they had provided the replacement product which is good and working well till now."
651,2,With 2 months stopped working,Initially It works. With 2 months stopped workingband battery backup is less.
652,4,Good Product,"The battery drains soon with the time.. So, you might need to charge battery more often but still does the work(killing mosquitoes). I have been using it for past 6 months.. Atleast better than other raquets which lasts for days or weeks."
653,1,Defective product.,"Defective product, getting noise on the hand like something is broken or not fit on the device which is moving forward and backward, also it's not working, there is an LED light but not lighting up, it's not killing any mosquito, red light is lighting up when put it on charge, but nothing else happening, waste of money."
654,1,Not working,Fake product received..even after 2 days of continuous charging its not working.. can't return it as more than 10 days hv been passed üòì
655,5,Bit overpriced,Quality is very good. But don't drop while keeping for charge it will get damaged for sure. They also give replacement if it doesn't work properly within 6 months.
656,3,Not awesome but usage wise it works,"Itis be ok on this price. But if you miss from your hands while rocketing, it will get damaged soon. Battery is polymer one. So you need to be charge once two to three days, depends on your usage. Body's plastic is little weight than others, older people feel hard to handle."
657,1,Worst product i have ever purchased,I have received damaged product and placed it for exchange. Got another one which was partially damaged again. I have been using it since a week and it just slipped from my hand and fell down. It's not working since then. i have wasted all the money purchasing this product which is of no use.
658,5,Very good built quality,Extremely robust racket. It's build quality is really solid and so far I've used it a lot and it's still going strong.
659,1,Want warranty service for this,The net on the racket has come out ..it was shaky wen it was bought but didn't didn't realise much but this thing has completely come out..led light turns on but no sensation on the net to kill mosquito I want the warranty service for this product
660,1,Highly unsatisfied,I ordered this considering that it would be a good quality product but I received a defected piece. The battery inside the racquet is not fixed and broken from inside. This product is of good quality as compared to other chinese products but i did not expected to get a defected piece from amazon. Highly unsatisfied
661,1,Wordt product,Worst productBrought 2 product in 4 months and both are not workingI trued claiming warranty it has been 7 days since i raised warranty and they are saying now it will take 10-15 days to get product replaced
662,1,No doubt the worst product I have received from amazon,It‚Äôs the worst mosquito bat there is out there. Payed ‚Çπ500 for absolutely nothing. The battery life is absolutely horrible - it lasts for about 10 minutes after 3 hours of charging. The design of charging is the worst design EVER. DO NOT BUY THIS THING. Now I can‚Äôt even return it because I observed for too long. Do not fall for the branding too!!
663,5,Pls dnt buy,The racket stopped working within 2.5 months from the date of purchase. It is better to buy a 200/- product from a retail store than spending 435/- for this one.
664,3,Defective item sent by the merchant.,The racquet looks nice but the buttons are flimsy. Received a defected item so placed a return request. What an inconvenience as I have read the merchant has offered many defective racquets to customers.
665,1,Godrej is proudly selling Chinese Products and calling himself Indian !!!,Godrej being Indian brand they have got this product from China. Disgusting !!!Not sure if Godrej is getting their other products from China. I will now think twice before going for Godrej products.If I had to buy some chinese product then why should I not go for MNC companies?
666,1,Product Received Looks Like Used or Refurbished,"Product i received was Looking like used one or Refurbished, there were plenty of Scratches around the Product. Product Box Seal was opened and full box pasted with transparent tape. There was No Manual also."
667,5,It's been a year ..,Trust me guys even if u get it @499 it's totally worth it . And no issues even after 6 months.Note : I am using this product daily.Update : 1 year passed it's still working .
668,5,"Don't think, just buy",Very good battery life. 1 charge gives at least 15 days with moderate usage of 1 hour per day. On stand by mode at least 1 month battery life. You can feel the quality when you take it in hand and also 6 month warranty. Great product
669,4,Very convenient. Long battery life,This is a very well made device. It is super convenient to charge and has a really long battery life. Recommended.
670,5,"Feels good, blue light is well positioned to highlight mosquitoes in flight",Feels well-built  and durable so far.  The blue LED light seems well positioned to light up mosquitoes in flight making it easier for you to hunt them when they try to blend in with your environment.
671,2,Not Working,Rocket stopped working after 19 days and Amazon no more own the ownership to return the product. It's very pathetic to connect with the seller and seller sireting to manufacturer.Still communication going on with Godrej(Hit).Not satisfied.
672,5,100% genuine must buyüëå,I had used this last 2 months its working fine. Battery life is also awesome one time charge for 30 to 45 min and it will work for a week. Led light feature make it diffrent from other seller products. Realy its so usefull instead of mosquito oil and other products. Five star rating üëå‚úåüëçthanks to godrej and amazon üôè
673,1,Hit mosquito bat stops in 2 months,"Bad battery,it stops working after two months use"
674,3,Not that great build!,Outer body is quite sturdy. But inner parts tends to get loose and make noise. Not that greatly built mosuquito bat!
675,5,Very powerful circuit and good light in dark,It works really well and immediately neutralises mosquitoes upon contact with great Sparks. The light is good too in pitch dark.All in all a good buy for sure.
676,1,Totally waste of money - not working,"Within 3 months it‚Äôs not working now. Charging light is visible during charging but, it doesn‚Äôt function. Totally, disappointed with product and felt like cheated as we paid high price compared to others believing the brand name godrej and cloud tail."
677,5,Good bat but quality of the material could be little better,"Good bat but quality of the material could be little better, it won't be long lasting if you hit the HIT in hard surface. So be careful."
678,1,After 5 days it became unusable.,It worked  good for 5 days only. Then it started bad performing.  Now it can't be used.Waste of money.  And now you can not replace it.
679,5,A product from reputed brand which is amazing,"I am totally satisfied with this product, it has a good built quality and received the package on time with good packaging"
680,5,Good,"I really love this badminton, it really works better than others badminton till now I have used."
681,1,Not worth product,"Good services provided by HIT but bad product.Product does not work after 2 days of delivery and replaced, replacement received in 4 days again after 3 days product got small amount of smoke inside the handle with burning smell and then refunded immediately. Refund is received with in 1 and half day."
682,1,Bad/No service by Amazon,"Received defective product. Makes a constant noise as if its killing mosquitoes. For return of product, I have to go to the post office personally and send the defective product by courrier. Amazon personnel will not take any responsibility or action once the product is delivered. Now i would always think twice before ordering from delivery."
683,1,Pathetic Amazon,I've applied for Amazon Pay credit card 3 times and no one has come yet for KYC verification. And that is backed with Amazon's Happiness Guarantee.
684,5,Decent product,A very powerful electric shock producing weapon for defeating those blood-sucking arthropods. Has a really long battery life and a blue LED that will help you locate the mosquito in dark. So it's overally a good product and worth every penny. Happy swatting zzz üòÇ.
685,5,Loved it..,"Product is same as shown in picture. Quality is great, I haven't charged it yet and if it's working great. Amazing performance and looks classy unlike other non branded ones. . Worth the price.."
686,1,Shock even when switched off,We are getting shock when touched the net by mistake even when it is switched off. How is that acceptable. I used several bats till date and non behaved this way even they are all lesser price. I believe there eill be some standards for these bats. Does the standards allow to get shock (not a simple one... It is considerable painful shock)?
687,5,Best mosquito bat,Very nice quality. Is the best mosquito bat we have ever bought.it is very powerful and build quality is also very good
688,5,Prep for Wimbledon with mosquitoes,There will be that one mosquito who trained under Neo and matrix their way to dodge this.But the for rest its tandoori time. Good stuff.If anything by the time you're done with it you will be prepped to enter Wimbledon and beat Rafael or Novak
689,1,Caution while buying,"Came with a broken plug, couldn‚Äôt charge it ever. Returned it immediately. Not saying the product range isn‚Äôt good, but we received a damaged product."
690,2,wotorthless,"Very fragile charging pins..once fallen, got damaged.. not worth of single pany because pins are loose to connect in socket and falls eventually.. then neither you can charge nor use.. so worthless"
691,5,Excellent utility product,"Pros: efficient,long battery life (single charge lasts for almost 10-14 days,sturdy bodyCons: website address of godrej to register this product for warranty doesn't register the productConclusion: excellent utility product"
692,5,Very Satisfying,That sense of achievement you get after instantly killing flies and that nice kuttt kuttt sound is just amazing
693,2,Worst battery life not even for 10 mins usage,After three months battery is getting worst .The charge is down very soon ....Other local brand cost 200 for a bat stands upto 2 month giving their best ...So hit bat is equals to cost of 2 bat and it last for 4 months However local company bat performance and life is betting than these  kind of compny bats...
694,1,"Not worthy, go for anyother bat","After 5 months of usage its battery life gone not able to fix the battery, that inbuild makes it worse not worthy. Again Waste of money."
695,3,Average product,Likes are sturdiness and brand/ dis likes not so immediate response while using press button on working on mode
696,5,Good bat in working condition,Has a good battery life and effective . Also has a small led light on the bat for darker areas . Is working well till now
697,1,Waste of money,LED stopped working in two days.Battery backup is less.Not up to the mark.Plastic quality is bad.
698,5,Good product if a tad expensive,"This is expensive as compared to its peers but worth it, in my view, owing to its sturdiness and long battery life."
699,2,Read the warranty clause,"Doesn't work properly after some time. If you want the warranty you have to register within 15 days of purchase,  which did not do as I hadn't read the fine print"
700,1,Worst product stopped working in less than a month after purchase.,I bought it going by the brand name hit. But I'm totally disappointed with it. My money has gone waste as the racquet has stopped working at all just within a month. It's good for nothing now.
701,5,Solid buildüí™.,"Product is made from good ABS plastic.. Build quality is amazing, Feels solid in hand when compared with other cheap mosquito rackets.Have to use at least for 2 months to check the battery back up and quality of the internal boards used.Amazon's delivery was little late and not on expected date. That's the only con.."
702,1,Cannot register warranty,have tried to register warranty but is says the invoice already registered! Not able to register warranty online very disappointed. I think must have received an old product
703,1,Worst product,Worst product...local brand is better compare to this....my operating button was not working properly after 1 month dnt buy guy's waste of money...
704,5,Probably my best investment of 2019,"This looks and feels much sturdier than the chinese ones you get on the market for less.Efficient in zapping insects. Needless to say, but keep away from small Children or infants. This is not a toy and could cause damage if misused or not carefully used."
705,2,Not good according to it's price,Product works fine in the first month but from the starting of second month it has started showing its real side in the first month it killed 80-90 mosquito in one full charge of 6 hours now it takes 7-8 hours and only killed 40-45 mosquitoNot worth it even though Chinese one are good in front of this product
706,3,Not working after a month,"Not working after a month, only LED working.Unfortunately not registered with given site I am not eligible for warranty.Better not to buy this product."
707,2,Registration process very tidious and unsuccessful,Not able to register it's warranty.tried at least 100 times wasting my timeStill not successful.site just goes on circling all the time.only once i reached OTP stage but OTP did not come on mobile ot mail.left detail's on there e mail .Please see to it.also left  voice message on their cust care number.
708,1,Worst Product,I bought this racquet in Decemeber and  Feb 11 it stopped working. Why would we chose a brand? Because it should atleast work for a year. It doesn't. It stopped working all of a sudden. Not satisfied at all. Waste of money. Its better you buy 150 rs racquet from roadside and that will work more than this.
709,5,"Battery 0/5, Durability 0/5.","I am writing this review after using this racket for 3 months, the battery life is not good as shown in the specification after charging it for 6 to 8 hours it can be used for only an hour and also it isn't durable. Suggestions for this product is not to buy this and also don't believe it's brand quality."
710,5,mosquito repellant racquet,"bought this only becos it was a 'Hit' product and found it to be quite an effective product, much better than the non branded ones I have bought in the past."
711,1,Pathetic service of product and returns,"During charging the charging led does not switch on and even post charging of 8 hrs it hardly works fr 5 mins, even return was cancelled citing refused by customer but infact no courier turned up to collect the item, very pathetic product and service altogether , stay out frm this item to avoid harrassment"
712,2,Bad buy - got a defective piece,The racquet doesn't charge and it doesn't work. Amazon has given me a defective piece. Initially it got charged and later with hardly any usage it stopped charging.... Very bad buy
713,5,Loaded with quality,"I bought two of them first, later ordered them for cousins. These are sturdy. I mean it. These are mosquito's electric crematoriums. Zaps them in no time."
714,1,Battery issue in hit mosquito bat,"At first the bat works fine. But after some months (4-5 month)usage, the battery just died. We need to recharge it every time, we want the mosquitos to be killed."
715,1,showpiece,Not a single mosquito gets trapped. Unfortunately the return window was closed so we had to discard a new one.
716,5,Well done HIT.,"Definately found a good weapon, also you get some hand exercise for free trust me."
717,5,Good Product üëç,Product is stopped working within a Month requested vendor for replacements as  Product is under warranty.  Awaiting replacementsRevised Review:I have received the replacement for the defective product as promised by the company.  Thank you very much
718,2,Highly disappointed,Not upto the mark. From Hit it's not expected. Within 2months it's stopped working. Charge is fine but the product not doing its job
719,1,Hit never hit,"Useless product, it doesn't work, moreover there is negetive response on product warranty registration. It seems by default the company has created product didn't get registration, hence no warranty!"
720,5,A very good product from Godrej.,This mosquito swatter is a value for money product with solid built and usefulness. Battery life is adequate and works perfectly.
721,1,Wastage of Money,I've purchased this product on 1 Sep'20 and there is problem detected in this product on 26 Oct'20. Warranty claim already been filled on Hit website but due to their poor customer service my problem still not resolved even after sending multiple follow up email to Godrej Customer service.
722,5,Superb product,Its a superb product. Having used various local quality I was deslighted to find a branded racquet finally coming in. It has so far lived to expectations.Just a minor point - It could have a loop for hanging..But very satisfied
723,1,Worst Experience Ever.,"1. Battery backup is worst part of this product. Works hardly for 10 minutes after charging more than an hour.2. More interestingly, it stopped working after fifth day of my purchase.Worst experience ever, didn't expected this from a well known brand (HIT). Totally disappointed."
724,1,Useless product,Whenit was delivered it was working properly but now it is not working . Nwo racket is not killing any mosquito.Please don't buy it is a  wast of monei have to give 1 star rating because they are not submit ing the review
725,5,Good Product,"Product is good till now after using it for more than 2 months.Single charge withstands for more than 10-15 days.Nothing to complain, lets see how long it goes."
726,2,Name Sake Warranty,So the warranty is just a marketing gimmick. You register on their site and provide your personal information for nothing. I have been chasing the seller for weeks as the device stopped working in 2-3months.
727,5,Great product,Love this one and this one is the second one I bought.  Very effective and powerful. Better than unbranded stuff had bought earlier.
728,5,Bad battery but good product,They said to charge after 15 days but it's not more than 7 days. The battery is weak. Otherwise product is a blessing in a country like India with so much mosquitoes.
729,1,Stopped working after 20 days.,"Initially we thouth our family got good product then truth was within 20 days it stopped working. Now can't return and don't know where to service.20 ‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æ≥‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç ‡Æµ‡Øá‡Æ≤‡Øà ‡Æö‡ØÜ‡ÆØ‡Øç‡Æµ‡Æ§‡Øà ‡Æ®‡Æø‡Æ±‡ØÅ‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø ‡Æµ‡Æø‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡Æ§‡ØÅ. ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡Æø ‡ÆÖ‡Æ©‡ØÅ‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡Æµ‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡ÆÆ‡ØÅ‡Æü‡Æø‡ÆØ‡Ææ‡Æ§‡ØÅ , ‡Æé‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡Øá service ‡Æö‡ØÜ‡ÆØ‡Øç‡Æµ‡Æ§‡ØÅ ‡ÆÖ‡Æ§‡Æ±‡Øç‡Æï‡Ææ‡Æï ‡Æé‡Æµ‡Øç‡Æµ‡Æ≥‡Æµ‡ØÅ ‡Æ®‡Øá‡Æ∞‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡ÆÖ‡Æ≤‡Øà‡ÆØ ‡Æµ‡Øá‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡ÆÖ‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ±‡ØÅ ‡Æ§‡ØÜ‡Æ∞‡Æø‡ÆØ ‡Æµ‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡Øà."
730,1,Doesn't serve the purpose.,"Not working properly. Just makes sound but doesn't kill mosquito. Makes sound even if no mosquito is contacted. Waste of money, better buy cheap ones at the signal. They atleast serve the purpose even if not durable enough."
731,5,Using it for a few months now. Battery life is very good. Durable product.,Using it for a few months now. Battery life is very good. Durable product. Traps mosquitos and flies easily.
732,4,Price is too high,"It was strongly built and I‚Äôm completely happy with the product performance and I don‚Äôt know it last long or not m. But we have to use it with care. Although it have a warranty of 6 months, it indicates that product will be good for months ‚Ä¶."
733,5,Good product,"The product quality is very goodGood packaging, very Sturdy, works beautifully.Recommended: if you want one."
734,1,Bakwas,It actually stops working right after 6 months. N your warranty is for 6 months. Chinese local market bats are better at half of its price..
735,5,Very Good for home,This is second one which I bought. Its very good power as compare to other bats and battery backup very good. Material quality is very good.
736,5,Quality Product,The battery charge lasts around the claimed one week so charging the product once a week is only necessary which extends the product life
737,5,Great quality mosquito bat,Compared to the majority china made bat brands this Godrej brand(but manufactured in China!) mosquito bat is good in all aspects.
738,5,Better than other products on the market,This is much better than what you get on the market. It's got good battery life and is of better quality.
739,5,Excellent mosquito bat,It is very good üëç and comrae to local and Chinese brands.Every month I have to buy mosquito bat after buying this one no need to buy
740,5,Great quality,It‚Äôs a very different product compared to it contemporary available in the market... built quality is very good.. though I find it a little pricey but I don‚Äôt mind paying if I get quality stuff...
741,5,HIT mosquito bat,Ofcourse it's very easy to use. I charged it once and it's more than a month and still going on. It's definitely value for money. Go ahead and buy it.
742,5,Good one,Good quality and strong body. Battery life bit low but enough for somedays with lot of mosquito
743,1,"Big brand, cheap quality","2 times purchased the item, both are not working after 2 months. There is no proper support to exchange under warranty.Waste of money, name sake it‚Äôs a brand but useless product.Local made is better than that & durable which is more than one year old"
744,5,Very good mosquito killer bat,This mosquito killer bat is very effective and really kills mosquitos nicely. Also its battery backup is strong.
745,1,Worst customer service no respond for warranty claim,Compleately stop working after 20 days. Return window is closed but when claimed for warranty company didn't respond. The overall build quality is good. But very sad to see this kind of response from the company.
746,5,Using since Oct 2019,"I coud see lot of negative reviews like stopped working after few days but contrary I am using this since 25 Oct 2019 without any issues. I dont use it extensively but use it regularly. Good battery backup too, I change it once amonth. I recommend to go for it instead of direct chinese (I hope one day, godrey will manufacture this completely in india)"
747,5,Product review,I bought myself in Dec'22 i liked the product it was good . When i have ordey second time they have given the faculty product i have asked for replacement . I hope i will not disappoint this time
748,2,Vocal for Local,Battery lasts for 1 days only after 7 hours charge.. Portal is not working for product registration on their website. Notified customer service over email but no response so far. Product is costly in comparison to local ones available in the market with same specifications and better battery life.
749,5,100 marks for quality,It's a brilliant quality product with good battery life. It lasts long for 3-4days. Plastic used is also of good quality. Worth buying at this price.
750,3,Stopped working within 10 days,"The parts inside the handle were not fixed and were rattlling, on the whole it worked for a week max"
751,2,No warranty,"Its written in description to register for warranty, when i filled the form, it came enter otp. And no otp came on mobile and email id. How to register for warranty?"
752,1,Its a overly priced crap. Dont ever buy,Its a crap. With all the positive reviews i ordered 2 pieces. But both are defective now within 3 weeks of usage and the battery is 3rd rated crap as well. Buy at your own risk!
753,1,Fake scam please dont read if you have enough money to waste,"Bought on 14 sept and today is 6 oct. This racquet had stopped working only blue light is glowing and red loght which shows "" charged"" state is not working.  Very bad product all of the claiming is fake.  Biggest scam. Its better to have 4 local racquets insted of this hit one."
754,1,Not buying this product,My review using one month later. Product quality good but..  battery back up  Very very dirty... west of many.. Same product available in market Rs.120/-
755,2,Not that great,"One of the worst purchases. I had received a used racquet with lot of scratches, the led never worked. I missed the return window. It hardly kills any mosquitoes."
756,1,Disgusting experience,"Disgusting experience. Durabilty is less than a month.Stopped working within a month.Tried reaching customer service but in vain. Didnt pick up the call, nor did they respond to voice message.I cant believe godrej sells such defective products. Never purchasing again . üëéüëé"
757,1,worst product,"worst product, Failed within few months, Unable to claim warranty ,Hit customer care also not responding"
758,1,Subpar quality,"The said 'durable' bat stopped working within 15 days, battery discharged twice during that period & one fine day it died, it still gets charged , but doesnt work anymore, the led night light is also useless, don't buy thos, local market's 120rs bats are more durable"
759,5,Amazing battery life.,Amazing battery life. I recharged it omce and have been using it for almost 20 days now. Still going good without recharge.
760,5,Great backup and efficiency,Excellent product great backup over ordinary local and Chinese brands. Performance vice excellent. Doesn't miss any mosquito.
761,5,Simply go for it. Don't compare price with Chinese product.,Don't compare price of this product with Chinese one. It comes with brand and it is worth. Instead of getting one Chinese bat for each season take this one for all.
762,1,"Poor quality, ""absolutely no response"" from Godreh Consumer","The product stopped working after 7-10 days, have been chasing company over e-mail, notes on website, twitter tagging their CEO and Head of Marketing for over 20 days, NO RESPONSE AT ALL. Don't waste your money on useless product and ABSOLUTELY NO SERVICE"
763,1,Warranty Link is Shady,"I am writing the review after using the product for a week, because the mosquito racquet is NOT WORKING ANYMORE! no physical damage nothing, stopped working for no reason. Boom.!! the warranty link is shady (tried to register on the day of delivery) Not worth 500 bucks. I recommend you guys go for the local racquet."
764,1,Disappointed,Within 1 month the product was not working.Sent mail regarding the same to the company but it seems they don't care about their customers.Still no response from company
765,3,Charging led not glowing,I just charged for once and it lasted for many days but on second charge it is not charging as I do not see the charging led on
766,1,Stopped working,Two times I purchased this bat first time I thought ramdom issue for stopped working Second time also stopped working within 2 months  useless warranty useless productWith brand name making people fools
767,1,Waste of money,The racquet stopped working in less than 5 months and I got it replaced through the warranty. And the replaced racquet also stopped working in 10 days. And now they aren't replacing the racquet. Waste of money
768,1,Worked only for 3 months,"Worked only for 3 months, I tried to register this product to claim the warranty but OTP has not been received on my  phone. So want to claim warranty --- but no option.  Looks Godrej is not providing Quality products. Local Bats that i purchased long back worked for atleast 3 -4 years. Website also not working"
769,1,"Don't buy worst product, don't get cheat with brand name","Don't buy worst product, don't get cheat with brand name Hit., The led given in blue colour just to fool us. No light in it and don't buy it's worst product... don't waste your money"

772,3,Good product but bad battery.,"BATTARYWhen Ibrought the product ,the advertisement show me that it has a powerful battary ,that will service ma at least 30days once I charged it properly.But actually it loose it charge within 3 or 5 days after charging.STRDINESSIt is very good and I am satisfied with it.DURABILITYIt is also very good and I am satisfied with it."
773,5,Works fine even after 9 months,"No problems yet, I am writing this review after 9 months of use.  Excellent experience compared to the other rackets I used, other rackets did not last 3 months."
774,5,Good product.,Really good product. Very sturdy. Power charge is good too. The led light is very helpful in spotting the mosquitoes properly.
775,3,Okay product.,"I am writing it after using it for 2 months. It is pretty good and sturdy. but the battery doesn't last for long, I need to charge it daily is the reason I am giving 3 stars."
776,1,Useless product,After charging for 7hrs....the racket dies not function well...amazon should immediately remove the product.

778,5,Very good and sturdy product,Very sturdy and good plastic quality.Good battery life almost a week time for daily night use with single charge.Much better than normal China imports available in market @ 200 - 250.
779,3,Not worth may be duplicate item,Not worth may be duplicate item
780,2,"Remove brand HIT from this , its just 100 rs bat that you get in store nearby",It says charging can stand upto one month i am not able to understand on what basis. You need to charge this almost daily. Also these bats doesn't kill the mosquitoes. You have to stamp on mosquitoes to make sure its dead
781,1,Made in China. And it doesn't work!!! Do not buy,"On Amazon it shows the country of origin as India, but on the box received, it said country of origin as China! Think before your buy.And it hasn't killed a single mosquito in 45 days!!! Doesn't work. Waste of my money"
782,5,Durable product,The product is durable with good battery life and is recommended to be purchased at this price. Many times better than the cheap ones available on road side for Rs 200 n above
783,2,Battery stopped working,Either battery or switch became faulty and some time even after proper charge and after pressing the button red led light doesn't lit
784,1,Poor quality and no response from Godrejcp,We purchased this raquet and it failed with in a week. We sent mail to Godrej consumer Products ltd. But no response. we could not register on website as it did not accept uploading the invoice . Poor quality - Dont buy as warranty is fake and seller is cheating.
785,2,Ok product. Quality could be better,"The material used is very sub standard. The battery life is good but the point to take out the socket to charge is spoilt, it keeps withdrawing and hence the racket falls from the socket."
786,3,Unbelievable Product quality.,It's a good product and kills mosquito even If it's in the vicinity of few centimeters.  It has anti human technology which if any human finger touches the racket and automatically gets turn off. Ultra long battery backup I last charged it 27 days ago but still working fine.
787,4,Proud to buy Indian Product.,This product quality is superb and finishing is very attractive. Blue light function for night is best one. I purchase 2 product after experiencing 1st product best service. I would recommend it to buy and proud on that Made in India mosquitoe racquet is available in market.
788,5,HIGHLY DURABLE PRODUCT,- High quality Product.- Works well. Value for money.- Amazing battery life.- highly durable product as compared to all the others available in market that are just a bit less in price but absolutely crap quality
789,5,Long lasting sturdy and good quality,the product is of good quality and sturdy too. It is an original product and battery lasts long.
790,5,"Received bad product, but godrejhit replaced it","After 15 days it had stopped working. I tried to claim warranty, but there is no response from godrejhit website.Update: Godrehit had sent me a new one, it is working fine now. Hope this one lasts long."
791,5,Good to see an Indian product,The product is very good compared to its price tag. Easy and convenient to use. Highly recommend
792,1,Please provide correct invoice to customers,When I brought I want to register the product with in 10 days to calim warranty for 6  months but as the bill is not provided clearly I didn't get the correct invoice number when you go to the site it asks about invoice which is terrible experience
793,4,Recommended to buy.. Useful product,Serves the purpose.. Everything is good from packaging to quality.. Only the Plastic seems not durable.. Let's see how long it remains in use.. Battery life is good.. Have charged only 3 times..
794,2,Self zapping,This we got  for swatting insects after reading its reviews and because of the brand. After one day of use it kept on zapping whenever switched on even without any insects. There were no objects enmeshed in the wire net.
795,5,Good quality,Much better than the hunter
796,5,Branded Things Work,"I liked the product due to its killing capacity and is not loosely held like cheap material available in market. So, after 1 week of use, I liked the working till now. Kills BOTH MOSQUITOES AND HOUSEFLY, or any such insects of similar size."
797,1,Indicating light is not working and awful noise is coming inside the product.,"It seems like something is broken in product, while picking in hand you listen. Woking Indication light is also not working. Seller shouldn‚Äôt have sent this product before checking. Amazon, please pay attention on these type of sellers, ther are ruining your prestige image."
798,5,WORTH IT,I bought it 6 months ago. It still works!! Good quality! One of the best mosquitoes electric bar to buy
799,1,Description misguide,"The product details says country of origin is India. But, the country of origin mentioned on the product is People's Republic of China. The product is imported and marketed."
800,1,not working,I bought it some 20 days back and it has stopped working. I didnt register at the website at that time. Can i still claim warranty somehow? It's has not been even 1 month!!!!
801,5,Good design,I like the added light to attract mosquitoes. Also backed by strong Godrej support and guarantee. Battery life is good after a week in operation.
802,2,Worked for less than 5 months.,"It was working perfectly fine at the beginning. Eventually it took little longer to kill the flies. And now after 4 months, it stopped working. Flies sit on the bat while I try to kill them and nothing happens."
803,1,Not work that longer,Quality is good for plastic and overall body but after 20 days of use battery is not good. I have purchased original only for battery durability. Do not purchase with expectation of longer life.
804,5,Buy this premium one instead of buying 4-5 cheap racquets in a year,"I've first purchased it in 2019. It worked well for 3 years and Battery drain. But still working. I've ordered another one as it may stop working after sometime. Instead of buying 4 to 5 racquets in a year. But this one, it last for years."
805,1,Worst product,"Worst product I ever buy from Amazon. I request to customers not to buy this product. Not at all worth for money. The battery is not holding charge till you charge for 5 hours. When you use, the power switches off. Also the charging adapter is not suitable for Indian electrical sockets. I recommend not to purchase this product."
806,1,Short lived,"The product worked well for 2wks, stopped suddenly after that. I‚Äôve tried charging for 5-6hrs and then using but no use !"
807,1,Not recommended to buy on believing it is brand and will last for long period,Worst experience with bat and Godrej customer care as don't provide us any warranty. Am tried of calling and informing every time I call to customer care. They don't even care. I believed it as it is a brand but badly disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è. Never to buy hot bat again
808,3,Hit Mosqito Bat,"Disappointed. When in use Battery last only less than half hour. Erratic performance. sometimes continues spark. delivered on june 15 with 6 months warranty. I destroyed the original packing because of covid scare, hence I cannot return it. Can the seller replace it free?"
809,5,"Go for it, dont think twice!!","I've used this for 2+ months good quality and battery stays long.Highly recommend, little annoyed with the light given its in blue colour. Its not at all helpful but when the bat works well the light wont matters the most."
810,5,Highly recommended if you have mosquitoes in the house,"Seems like a sturdy product. It does what it says perfectly. The light, however, is a gimmick and not at all useful."
811,3,Battery problem,Battery is not lasting longer. Bat quality is good.
812,5,Buy it,This one is really good. The same one I had earlier and it lasted for 2 years without trouble.
813,1,Worst product. I want to return.,Please dont buy..Customer care reply: I really sorry you need to contact the customer support then they will be guiding you the process to claim the warranty .I want to replace the product. Stopped working after 2-3 days. Only the LEDs are working.
814,1,Better buy cheaper options,In just 6 months this product stopped working. Does Hit provides the circuit board which one caan replace and use the Bat for longer time.
815,2,Battery issue after 3 months,"Worked super awesome for 3 months. Then battery went so dead, it now works for 15 seconds on a full day charge. Quite useless"
816,1,Burnt in a month,"Very poor quality, hardly lasted a month. On second charge, burnt and marked my wall with black soot."
817,1,Returned it,"The item was defective and returned in hopes of a new working one, but the same defective one was packaged and delivered again. What a waste of time"
818,5,Value for money,Good product
819,1,"Not durable, stopped working!","Stopped working after a few light hits. My old mosquito bat was like a metal bat, and it still works. Hit Anit Mosquito Racquet is so weak lol. Waste of money, it isn't durable and the light is so useless. Only good thing is the size of the racquet, can cover large area."
820,5,Highly Recommended,"Most sturdy HIT Anti-Mosquito Racquet, having long-lasting battery life. Better than what is available in the market."
821,5,Very good product,"Very good product and has good shape to trap mosquito even in corners, battery life good,  heavy and sturdy"
822,5,Original tough product,When you open the box..what you see is originality ..Just loved it..And it seems durable tooAnd comes with a warranty card tooIt's  worth your moneyThankyou amazon
823,5,"Go For it , Godrej service is damn good","There is no reason to dislike the product.As compared to another product its far better in quality.Warranty service is good , I have used and they are fast."
824,2,HIT mosquito racket,one of the two items stopped working... wonder if I can get a replacement.? Return window missing on Amazon
825,1,Not recommended,"I ordered 2 , both of the bat got damaged and 6 month warranty also didn't get , disappointed"
826,1,Wrong country of origin : It's a china product.,"Wrong country of origin provided in the description as ""India"". The product is ""made in China"". This is cheating by seller."
827,4,Worth buying,"Battery life is good and not sure about warranty process, if anything goes wrong with product"
828,5,Worthy Product from HIT,This Bat serves its purpose and it retains battery for more than a week. Its a worthy purchase. You can rely on it for its performance. I bought one more for my Dad too.
829,5,HIT Anti Mosquito Racquet- Useful for Mosquito killing,"I like HIT Anti Mosquito Racquet as its battery is life of 3 days for Mosquito killing. Earlier I am using local Racquet, but I have to change it 6 months as they are not durable."
830,1,Please don't buy !!,Within 2 months it stopped working and their link to register for warranty is even not working. I mailed too but no reply there too.Worst service and product from HIT.
831,5,Great product,"Best quality product from Godrej.Best built in quality,easy to handle.First charging stand for 10 days.I am recommending the product ."
832,4,Good,"First time buying a branded one, it works fine, will see how long it lasts, registered in website for warranty, but it did not ask how many qty. Amazon bill is very important for that, and it looks dim. Thermal bill."
833,5,Good products,"I received a damaged unit, within 5 days they replaced with good one. Quality is good. Gives confidence in online shopping"
834,4,Good buy,"Wanna kill mosquitoes ? Get this bat.It's good. Light weight, the blue light helps in killing the mosquitoes.One of the best bats in the market.Worth the price"
835,1,Worst one,Never buy this product. The product has stopped working after 3 months. I got a replacement and the new device alo stoped working with in 2 months. So please keep away from this bad quality product.
836,1,Totally disappointed with the product,It‚Äôs a very bad product... I received the product on 15/08/20 and within 1 month it stopped working...by 15/09/20 the mosquito racquet was not switching on... very disappointed with the product... waste of ‚Çπ425... tried calling the customer service but no one is answering the call...
837,3,Average product,Battery isn't durable degreded very fast just after 3months. Battery only last few minutes after whole night charge.
838,5,Very good product,"I am writing this review after 1year of use, it is the best mosquito bat I have ever used. No problem till now. Still charging once a week."
839,4,Fires without touching anything,The bat is strong and build quality is sturdy unlike cheap chinese bats. However it often misfires even it did not touch the mosquitoes. Otherwise it works perfectly fine and recommended for effective mosquitoes control.
840,4,Very Useful,Everything is good in this product. Quality is good. But the LED light attached is not sufficient to see in dark. Its blue and someone can not see properly through that light in dark.
841,4,Customer Care Service,Its is very difficult to claim warranty. The team takes atleast 15 days to replace your racquet and customer service is pathetic. Dropping a mail or calling on toll free number doesn't affects the service. They do what they want to do.
842,1,Waste,"Bogus racket......stopped working after 2 days. Even after charging for 7- 8 hrs, don't kill a single mosquito.And most important thing...it is made in China..."
843,5,Great product.,Everything is fine about this product. Been using it regularly and have had no issues at all
844,5,"Superb product, Need small improvement on packing","Superb product.. a must buy, the light attracts the mosquitos so no need to swirl the racket around...As a feed back to company picture is attached. The safety transit tape for switch is really ugly. Impossible to remove. Pls use easily removable tape."
845,1,Power quality,I have purchased this product and found not working now also want a replacement for the same kindly take back the defective and replace with a new one.
846,5,Unmatched,"Unlike local rackets, doesn't request mosquitoes to die. Ir kills them in hordes, blasting then away. Lasts for days in single charge"
847,1,No claim registration in warranty,Bat stopped worki f in 2 months... Cannot claim warranty as site not working... Customer support call getting disconnected... Need another bat.. But not sure how to contact
848,5,Presently the best available,Sturdy equipment from Godrej. I bought 3 such racquets but one of them started creating crackling sound when button is pressed
849,5,Durable and Effective in killing mosquitoes.,"I have been using HIT mosquito bat for last 6 months now, much better compared to other low priced and quality bats. Not very expensive. The battery life is better. It's safe and user friendly. It's is better to use this bat that lighting coils, agarbathi."
850,5,Such exceptional quality by HIT!,"Everything about this product is perfection. Can't argue on anything. Can't ask more. Has LED light, retractable charging slots, sturdy design, 1-year warranty, stylish design and reliable battery. Go for it!"
851,5,Hit mosquito bat,"Using it for few months now, sturdy one. Couldn't sign up for warranty (within 10 days) as mentioned in the product, but hope if maintained well will come for sometime."
852,5,Good quality,Using it from last 3 months. No issues. Charge last for long.

855,1,Don't buy.,"Don't buy this ,after 16 days it stop working .paying 5 times more amount but ,it's not worth."
856,4,Average quality,This is a China product . I expect Godrej products are maid in india.Please don't  buy cheep China productsGodereg can make products in india
857,1,Product arrived dead,"The product arrived dead. It is not working. Left it on charge for over two nights, hoping its just a dead battery, but no use.Unfortunately, people at home threw away the original packing so unable to process a return."
858,5,Very good product but costly.,The product is definitely a 5star product but it little bit costly. It should be priced around Rs 300.
859,2,Defective,"Its been only two weeks since I bought the product, it is not charging anymore. The charging metal part is not working properly and it gets stuck. I missed the amazon return by one day. I have claimed for warranty on the HIT website. Still waiting for their reply."
860,1,This racket has stopped working,This has stopped working within two months..was not even using it regularly. As the product comes with six months warranty I request amazon and seller kindly replace it.

862,2,Charge not lasting,Charge is not lasting
863,1,stopped working after one week.,"really bad, didnt expect this from Godrej (HIT) company. there is just some electric noice that comes when the machine is on, but does not kill any insects."
864,1,Not working,Really worst product. First it came it was not working at all..so replaced the product and again it came and same it was not working so thought to refund it this time but refund it not available for this product.Not recommended to buy this brand.
865,1,Not long-lasting,The product lasted just one month. Internal circuit got broken after a month and cannot be fixed. Not recommended to but at this price.I have one local mosquito bat bought in 150 INR and that is working since one year.
866,4,Purchased due to brand name and warranty.,"Found a good product after using lots of Chinese racquet. Durability is good, don't need frequent charge."
867,3,"Great Racquet, but stopped working after 1 month",Very good racquet and very powerful too.  Very wide compared to other products.  I bought two of these and 1 has stopped working after a month.  Has registered with Godrej HIT and I am trying to claim the warranty on their website.  Hopefully should get replaced.
868,1,waste product and return is headache as self return avaialble.,Did post not sure money is back or not. But it's too much headache better to get from market with well tested.
869,5,Go for it!,Very good battery life. Reliable item. Purchased 3 pieces overall for myself n family over a few years. Very satisfied with the purchase.
870,1,Product not working and order placed for replacement,Mosquito racquet which I received is not working and on Nov 23 I have placed replacement order. It is showing status as we will mail you when we have an estimated delivery date. Can you please take immediate action as this replacement order placed one week back
871,1,Charging pins,"Charging pins are not holding the bat in the wall socket firmly, hence loose connection and bat falling from the socket for small disturbance also"
872,1,Did not last even for 4 months,"Purchased mosquito racket in August 21, it stopped working in Dec 21.Disappointed"
873,5,Best Mosquito Racket Ever,"Very Nice Quality, Better then whats available in local market which are all  Chinese products."
874,1,Worst experience,"within days it was not working, so exchanged it. Then the exchanged one is not working in 3 months. Though it is within warranty period, the policy doesn't work. Don't buy it."
875,4,Good mosquito bat.. But don't drop it..!,Pros: Good quality net and easy to useCon: battery does not least for 30 days as mentioned... You need charge after 24-48 hours.Inside battery not properly fitted.. after dropping twice...I can here battery moving while shaking bat.
876,5,"Just bought it. It's really sturdy, good in comparison to similar product I have purchased earlier.",I went in for the brand 'Hit'; they did not disappoint me. Functioning well right now.
877,5,An excellent racket which traps mosquitos easily.,"An excellent racket, which is sturdy, has a very good battery life and gives relief from mosquitoe bites, by killing them instantly.Very very happy with the product and have gifted it to at least a dozen people."
878,1,"Battery discharge in an hour, bad product","Battery life is very poor,just in an hour discharge battery.experiencing bad product, never like to purchase again and never like to recommend this product brand. Its just a waste of my money .HIT company make me fool"
879,4,Quality and sturdiness are good for,Bat looks strong and battery life also good compared to other brands. I feel it is been overpriced.
880,1,Never buy,Pathetic Chinese product selling in the name of Made in IndiaGodrej disappeared and cheated
881,5,A worthy product,"On heavy use, the charge stays for two days. Build quality is good and seems durable."
882,1,"Worst product, do not buy, please save your hard earned money.","Yes, it is behaves like a chinese product. Worst product, do not buy. It did not even work for two days. Save your money."
883,5,It does the job well!,Very easy to use and helped us get rid of those pesky insects that plague us in the monsoons. Also good to see the HIT brand do this with a warranty.
884,1,Rattling sound in the handle of the racquet,The battery is detached inside the handle of the racket and it makes a rattling sound
885,2,doesn't work most of the time,"it fails to catch mosquito most of the time, probably something wrong in wiring design. also, works only on one side (bat must be facing down to catch mosquito underneath). handle became misaligned within few days. slider for charging pins is poorly designed and often causes hurt while operating"
886,5,Worthy,Bought on 2 months back.its a must product in cities.Super battery life and the bat is very durable and powerful.
887,5,It's worth,I m using this product science 3 months. The device is really sturdy. Previously i have used local bats but this one is well built and far better than the local bats available. I think because of its good quality the cost is bit higher than the local bats available. But it worth
888,1,Useless product.Did not last for even 3 days. Don't even honour warranty. Cheat company. Don't Buy,Useless product. Did not last for even 3 days. They don't even honour warranty. Cheat company.

889,1,Defective product,"The round circular button that‚Äôs used to kill the mosquitoes isn‚Äôt working now, purchased less than a month ago and Amazon‚Äôs return window is already closed, it‚Äôs as good as junk now, don‚Äôt buy online"
890,5,Best in market,Best mosquito net.It had fallen from a 4feet height and still working which was unexpected. Very light weight
891,4,Worthy and effective,Worth buying it. Battery backup is really good. Rest of it like normal mosquito bat.
892,2,Claim for warranty services.,I purchased the item on 1st Feb. 2020. It gave excellent service for about 3 months and now it is not working anymore. The product is under the warranty period of 6 months as mentioned in the sale invoice. Please help me to claim warranty service.

895,5,Better than cheaper Chinese bat.,It's good bat. Specially led light in dark. Battery life is better than Chinese one.
896,2,Turn off switch is too fragile,Bad news - the switch to turn it off and on isn't that sturdy due to which it broke off after 3 or 4 times rendering it useless.Good news- I had registered for the 6 month warranty and this happened within the warranty period so there was a hassle-free replacement by the HIT company.
897,2,Look for other option,I bought this product during March 2021 and after 2 months with has stopped working as it does not sparkles. Though I have registered this product but I was not expecting this to be more durable..
898,1,Defective,The product is effective but I received a defective product. I have used this in the past and it‚Äôs one of the best. However this time I received a product where the charging pin is broken. I had disposed off the packaging so I can‚Äôt return this.

900,5,Does the job,"Overall build quality is awesome. Cause I had taken a local brand and it just stopped working after a week or so.  This just does the job for you. After regualr use,. I just feel like there should be some other way to kill mosquitoes.  .this is too harsh was to die üòë"
901,1,It got short circuit within 15 days,"Worst experience with the product. No guarantee/warranty how long it will last.After normal (not high) usage for 15 days, the racquet stopped working and when we had gone to the local repair shop they said this is a case of short circuit and beyond repair."
902,1,Hype hype and poor customer service!!,I bought this after seeing it as #1 seller but it wasn't working and just a hype with the brand name HIT. I sent it back as replacement few weeks ago but I still didn't get a replacement. Poor customer service and hence I recommend NOT to buy this product.
903,4,Good product in affordable price,"Strong and durableEasy to useBattery life is good* It is only helpful to kill mosquito , if you try to kill housefly or any types of bugs it is not very helpful."
904,1,A useless product. Will not last for more than a month. Waste of good money,Useless product. Stopped working after a month. Dead as a dodo. Waste of good money
905,1,Not lasting,Didn't even last for 6 months even after charging it. Warranty is of no use. They don't do anything.

910,5,Very good product,This product is very useful and this is working without problem ... it kills mosquito fast
911,5,Good product,Very durable and battery life is good. Easily lasts for 6 days on moderate usage. Much better than china bazar/ Dmart products.
912,1,Very bad quality and not at all durable,"Do not buy this product, rather go with other brand. Stopped working within 3 months. Warranty claimed online but nothing happened. when called customer care they put you in queue to speak to agent but always call get disconnected in 30 seconds. Very bad after sales."
913,1,Worst experience ever,I bought this a few days ago and tested this as soon as i received.  It doesn't work at all. Red light is turned on when it is being charged. But eventually it's not working after i got this off the charger. And i don't know how to refund or change.. i feel so upset.
914,2,"Bought few days back. It is NOT working now. No value for money. Big brand, wrong product.","With in weeks, stopped working. Not getting charged. No lights indicated. Not killing mosquitos. Big brand, not a good product.No value for the money invested"
915,2,"Bought two. One working well, other faulty",I bought one few months back. Working nicely. Ordered one more few days back but it stopped working after just one day of use. Cannot return as I disposed the original packaging.
916,4,It's a good and steady product.,"Nice finish, acts well, good grip. Nice product, branded as HIT, it's a hit at home"
917,5,Charging issue,"After five months of purchase, frequent charging required.Does not work more than 10 minutes."
918,3,Made in China product,Godrej is very careful and they haven't mentioned where it is manufactured. This could be definitely China manufactured product.
919,1,I want replacement,"it stopped working, my 6 month old child is getting victim of it now. mosquitos are biting her now, its been two days when i placed a request. no one responded."
920,1,Mosquito passed,"I could see a mosquito passing through the mesh & waving at me. I felt both good & bad about it. Bad- I can't even kill a mosquito. Good-Nobody died because of me.In conclusion, mosquitoes are nature. Don't kill them."
921,3,Charging Pins should make bigger and larger!,Bat looks nice and cute But charging pin looks so thin The Pin does not fit tightly while charging by hanging in the wall It is always falling down! Other company bat‚Äôs the charging pins made by bigger than Hit !  I am not satisfied about this pin!
922,3,It‚Äôs good but not that effective,It is good product. Mosquito after getting shock also are alive. We need to give them multiple shocks üòÇ.
923,1,Battery got weaker after 3 months,"Battery works for only 3 months and that is all you have in anti mosquitoes racket,if batteries didn't works then its waste of money,don't deserve the price and to buy.Local racket is way better than this Hit Anti Mosquito Racket bcoz it comes in high price and works upto 2 to 3 months properly."
924,5,it is working,product is good but cost is too high. More than Two years back i bought one at a price of Rs. 200/- only and it lasted for till i purchased this one.
925,5,It's good,"Initially it didn't performed well but after 2 full charging it's working fine and has a good backup, amlost used for 15-20 days in a single charge. LED light also gives good vision at night."
926,5,Value for money,Very good and value for money product... keeping the HIT Brand name high....go for it...much better than any other mosquito racket available on online platform / local market.
927,1,Problematic Battery alert,I tried registering my purchase on company's webpage as it was directed but it failed to get register but i left tge page trusting hits big brand and unfortunately My Raquets battery swole up within few days of purchase to which i cannot claim the warranty perhaps.
928,5,Pathetic didn't even work for 1 month,Didn't even work for 1 month. When we keep it on charge it shows that it's charging but after hours of charging you use it and it doesn't work.The product has a warranty. Claimed it's warranty for which it said that we'll give a call. No call yet.
929,1,Worst product ever received on online platform.,This product is not reliable at all. I could use it for only two days and on the third day it stopped working. Don't go for the Amazon Brand. Will ecommend people to buy lesser known brand which would worth the money than this useless product
930,5,Good Quality Mosquito Bat,"Very sturdy and heavy.  Has good battery life and easy to use.  There is a small LED light as well - there isnt much use to catch mosquitos but, acts like a small torch for my parents some times."
931,3,"Good bat, ensure to claim warranty w/o fail","Make sure to register for warranty within 10 days of purchase in godrej website, check product detailed description for website details. The bat's sturdiness is good, battery life is decent but one of my bats stopped working within 5 months of purchase. I have claimed warranty now"
932,4,Grt product..,This product is very niyc. It's also very easy to use and has a good battery lyf. One can use it for 2 to 3 days when charged for about 4 to 5 hrs ... i liked this product...

From the day 1 not working. Item received and cancelled same day 15-Nov. But return taken on 29-Nov.
935,4,Good product,"So far so good ... using it for about a month now... does what it has to do... and has a good blue light as an add on too which looks good but is of not much use.. sturdy , strong and kills mosquitos.."
936,1,Dead on Arrival,Dead on Arrival. Never worked and I open it after the return policy unfortunately.Buy these locally. Don't buy online
937,5,Instant relief from humming mosquitoes,Nice product for getting instant relief from mosquitoes. You have to take care to not bang it on the walls or any hard surface while attempting to sieve the mosquitoes. Battery life is excellent and it lasts for weeks in a single charge.
938,1,Stopped working after 10days,Not very durable. Even before it stopped working it wasn't very good for killing mosquitoes unless they were larger than normal.
939,5,Good Indian Product good power and built,Good Product quite sturdy.  Hope it will justify the cost and have durable life span.
940,1,Not working now,Not working now but product has not any physical damage
941,1,Average product,"After using 1 month, it is not powering on. If price is 2.5 times higher than atleast product should worth it."
942,1,Pathetic Product..Fooling customers by using Brand Name,"The most pathetic product I have ever used.Bought 2 pieces both not working, its surprising how these companies try and make a fool if people by taking advantage if their brand name.In this case HIT.Personally suggest never to buy this item, a local non branded product is better than this item."
943,4,little expensive but good quality.,"Battery life will be known only after use of few months, One month on it is working well"
944,5,Good quality product,"Works really well, Was a great help before Diwali when a lot of insects trouble you."
945,3,Efficiency reduces by time,It was super good initially but after a month its efficiency reduced... it doesn't give that popping sound when it contacts the insect.. disappointing... good battery life..
946,5,Reliability,I purchased local raquets for mosquitos. It worked only for 1 week.HIT Anti Mosquito Racquet is reliable and lasts longer
947,5,Highly recommend to buy üëçüëç,The product is really too good. Their are also cheaper mosquito racquet available but they aren't good . It has 6 months warranty also. Best mosquito racquet at reasonable price. Just Go For It ...........üëç

949,5,Best product,"Best product, I have bought the Chinese ones in the past and they are just not good. This one is worth buying. Will have to see the durability of the product though"
950,1,"Bad quality stops working, no warranty","So 3 months after buying the battery died, I created a warranty request, they send me a new racquet after 20 days, but right out of the box that racquet did not work, I called them, mailed them but no response. Useless product utter useless warranty."
951,1,Don‚Äôt buy,In one week only performance started going down and it has become worst now . You can‚Äôt kill five Mosquitoes at one time it goes in hang state I recommend not to buy this bat
952,5,A Better Hunter,"I used this bat for the first time and I am impressed the way it works. The other bats I used were expensive and smaller compared to this one. After one week of use, I would recommend it over the other yellow bats. Additionally, it has UV type light which looks good but not sure of its use.Durability, not sure of this at the moment."
953,4,Battery Hungry,Usually We have a lot of mosquitoes.This is showing a good effect but not up to mark.And it is battery Hungry getting down in just an hour.
954,2,Service issue as refund window closed within 6 month as warranty product.,"5 month life only. And return window closed on next month only as 6 month warranty.Tried to return within 6 months but unable to return due to return window closed.Not expected this from Amazon, specially AMAZON CHOICE PRODUCT purchased."
955,5,Very strudy and strong- Go for it,"Have used this product for 3 months now-Very sturdy, long battery life of atleast 2 weeks, very powerful and useful.My purpose is served. I use it on a daily basis and it is working very much fine.Go for it in case you require one."
956,1,It stopped getting charged as soon as the return policy in Amazon expired,"Warranty from HIT is a waste of time, we enter the details and claim warranty and nothing happens after that. The bat stopped working right after a month of its purchase and we are unable to charge it. VERY BAD QUALITY. and 500 Rs for this bat is absolute waste"
957,5,Is very powerful,"This bat is has good power, doesn't miss any mosquito, battery life is also good and unique feature is blue light at the edge.The product i got had minor scratches on plastic surface which can be ignored."
958,5,Wonderful product,"Initially bit skeptical about performance of this product.. However, it has been working well. Able to kill lot of mosquitoes in one go."
959,4,"Not bad , price was too High ..","Not that much good , ok product built quality was too good but the battery life sucks every day I used to recharge battery for 1hor , and very efficient one but battery suck sooner."
960,4,Simple and super,"Very nice, sturdy design and works well.  It also has LED light  to use in the dark.  Worthy product to have."
961,1,Not working,"Bought 2 racquets from Amazon, but one was not working after 2 days delivery and another one is not working after one month of use. It's a defective product."
962,3,Good but very expensive,"Product is good but I guess at the price of 499/- is very expensive, would get 2 Bats at the same price from a super market"
963,5,good product,the usability & product is good safe useful only helpful if covers for the warranty period
964,1,battery is poor,the racket's battery is poor and it stops working after few days. For warranty claim also no provision is made from godrej HIT racket and no customer care of godrej answer the query
965,1,Poor product,Just 3-4 months and it started troubling. Company did nothing while contacting for warranty till today. It's a total loss of money.
966,2,After six months usage Battery rechargeable  life has gone,After six months usage the Battery rechargeable  life has Gone.Bought this  costly productWhen cheaper versions were available in Market thinking thatIt will last longer rechargeable battery.No support available for buying rechargeable battery replacement.No one to listen.....
967,4,Good Quality!,Nice Product. Purchased many Mosquito bats several times and none of them last for a month. But HIT anti Mosquito Bat works very well and personally feel is a must have item in any household to safeguard the family from insects/mosquitos!
968,1,Faulty product,Received a product which was not working. Returned it next day of receiving it.
969,4,Best compared to others available in market,"Life of the bat is around 1.5 years, which in my experience has been the longest compared to similar products available In market.. Quality of product overall is superior..."
970,5,Great product,"Great Product, though I received a faulty product but Amazon did exchange really fast and to my satisfaction. It is effective."
971,5,Nice for even tiny fruit flyies,"Nice for flying insect, I am using it for to kill small fruit flies work nicely. No more worry. I don't know about battery life how much last long. At present it is working fine."
972,1,1 month old product and doesn‚Äôt kill mosquitoes any more.,It‚Äôs just been a month since I purchased it and  my money seems to be wasted.It doesn‚Äôt kill the mosquitoes anymore.I purchased HIT brand‚Äôs products to ensure that we have the best quality product but they have miserably failed.
973,5,Ok not so good,Nice experience but not do useful such I charge it 6 to 8 hours continuesly but battery died very fast but okk
974,5,Very good,"Very good product. Battery life is very good, one charge runs for over a month. Switches are good and very effective"
975,2,"Weak battery, high cost,",No benefit of buying The Godrej product as other non-branded rackets are available at much cheaper rates. battery is very weak it does not work more than 15 minutes.
976,2,Charge does not hold for long.,It works for 30mins after you remove from charging. After that it looses power quickly. Basically it looses power so quickly that it is hardly of any use. Please do not buy. You can go for any Chinese crap which are half the price.
977,5,My best buy on Amazon (Yet),"This is my best buy on Amazon (yet) and I have also bought iPhone here which comes close second.I have used many similar products, but this comes top. Others had failed after couple of weeks. This one is going strong post 8+ months. I'd recommend this one."
978,5,Best in the market,Very effective in killing musquitos . The design & quality is also very good.
979,5,Superb Quality Mosquito Racket,"Good packaging, First impression about products is very impressive. Built up quality is Best! Battery back up Good, Led light is in Blue color and produce sufficient light. Overall 4.5/5China rackets definitely will failed in front of this.."
980,4,Ok OK product,nothing spl in it serves purpose. Not happy with the charging pin and setup. Should have given separate cable and pin arrangement like cellphone.
981,1,Faulty piece. Not started. Had to return..,Product was not working even after full charging. So I returned it. And not ordered again. Now using another with half of its price and satisfied
982,2,Not a good product,"Very bad product. Battery exhausted in a month's time. Not expected such a garbage thing from Hit/Godrej. Depite charging for 2-3 hours, it doesn't work."
983,1,Bad experience,"Worst battery life, stoped working after 5 days of purchase. i requested for its replacement. for 1 month its showing item is out of stock we will email you once its back. now unable to replace it"
984,2,Warranty is just for product marketing.,I bought this product 2 months ago. But it is start to spark itself just by clicking it on. Even i mail for repair/replacement 2 weeks before but nothing happened except mail and messages for hit.
985,5,A fair buy,Lasted for a long time now compared to the cheaper versions in local market you can get.
986,5,Good product,Using it for more than a month. Works as expected. Still working with first charge.
987,1,"Not happy with the product, received damaged product and bat is very lite in weight.",Sorry Amazon for the first time I received a defective product from your side and till now you didn't initiated product picup and refund process.
988,5,Solid Product,The product package and the product itself gives you a premium feeling. It works really well. The battery life is good. Easy to use. Overall it's a nice buy.
989,1,Not worth the money,"Stopped working on 3rd day of usage , also the body is not strong. When u use it the plastic make sounds in the had. Poor quality"
990,3,The size of the net is small,"Since the size of the net is small, you miss the mosquitoes and you have to get up and chase them. They should make a bigger size"
991,2,Battery ok circuit failed,"Stopped working after 8 months. It served its warranty period but couldn't sustain further. Investment of 455 for just 8 months, not worthy. Battery ok but circuit failed."
992,1,Product quality is very poor,When I got this product..getting  some noise like something broke in the racquet but it was working..suddenly  stopped working..it's more than a week now to raise complain but no response  till yet from the company
993,4,I‚Äôm batting for this - it‚Äôs a hit!,"Finally a good quality mosquito bat, as compared to the Chinese products that have flooded the market. Has been holding up very well, including the battery life."
994,5,Highly recommended,The Build Quality is very good. The longest lasted mosquito Racket is have ever used. Also comes with warranty. Make sure to register for warranty on their website after delivery
995,1,awful useless product,"Awful useless product I ever purchased on amazon ! switch is stuck batery does not last more than few hours.. both problems from day 1 of purchase, dont buy this crap.. I'd break it on sellers head."
996,1,Don‚Äôt waste your money,"It doesn‚Äôt kill mosquitoes AT ALL, just gives them a light electric shock. Such a waste"
997,5,Elegant,A good and handy one.  Impressive look and design. Serves the purpose well.
998,5,Battery life not good,"Very good built quality, effective. Battery life could have been better considering the price."
999,3,Below average product,"It is just the hype. The battery does not long last for 1 hour also. I bought it yesterday. After 4 hours of charge as it is mentioned, after first mosquito died, the second one just passed through. They say it will long last for one month which is a myth."
1000,5,Best mosquito racquet,"Have been using it for over a month now. Amazing battery life, size is big which makes it easy to catch mosquitoes. I would say its the best mosquito racquet in the market."
1001,2,Not working_purchased 2 months back,Two months and this product has stopped working. I tried reaching out to the team but their contact number is incorrect. I dropped them a mail but there is no revert. What is the use of 6 months warranty if the team is not responding on priority basis...?
1002,1,Recived used and defective product,Product is used and defactive charging is not taking place sparking sound is keep on going without any mosquito or anything. I purchased this product after seeing the reviews but after receiving the product I get to know that the sell is actually a crook.
1003,2,The inbuilt is poor,I purchhased 10 days back battery has bcome loose inside.Not durable
1004,3,Nice product,Does the job.But in some cases even after insect is hit it seems hardly injured.Require 2-3HITS
1005,5,"Best built quality and long battery life racquet, works perfectly","Best built quality, perfect design, battery life is awesome, light weight, great value for money, slightly costlier as compared to chinese warranty less racquets."
1006,1,Very bad experience,This product looks and durability seems good.. but the battery life is very .. Even after 8 hrs recharge it won't last more than 10 minutes..After even claiming for warranty the bat didn't got exchanged
1007,2,Isn't effective after three months,I got this racket in September but it stopped working after three months and isn't effective anymore even after a lot of charging. I really feel cheated  and trust me I haven't messed with it in anyway.
1008,1,Don't buy this. Waste of MONEY,As soon as the so called warranty ends the Racquet is dead too. Please amazon do some Qualty check before selling the products. You guys are selling all the defective items and this is NOT the only case
1009,3,Made in China,"CHINESEYou advertised it as Indian make,but shown on packing as Made in China.T This is not fair, it's cheating"
1010,3,the quality looked nice but product stopped working in 8-9 months,everything looked good and worked well but it has stopped working after 8-9 months. not sure if these products last only this much
1011,4,Strong sparks when mosquitos make contact with both grids,The sparks are sufficient to kill mosquitos.seems that the high voltage generated is not sufficient to initiate sparks when mosquitoes are not making direct contact with both the grids
1012,1,One Day durability product,"It doesn't even last for 2 days... It worked 1st day and then didn't work at all. Mosquitos were clearly flying near racket but it stopped working. Then, I charged it's battery considering that as a reason of not killing mosquito. Later, tried with it once again, but found the racket at fault."
1013,5,Sturdy and good quality,"It's of very good quality, expensive but worth ... instead of buying cheap quality for less price and keep changing every now and then, this is a good buy"
1014,1,Worse product under name of godrej brand.,"This is a worse product in my total buying product on Amazon and I am sure I never loged complaint for any product but with this product I am not satisfied because it's battery life is almost zero/ nothing so don't sell this product to others and please check and replace it,  I am sure this is a unfair trade practice."
1015,1,Stopped working in a month. Mosquitoes have returned soon.,Stopped working in a month time. The local brand ones lasted much longer than this. Regret the purchase at premium price.
1016,5,Awesome battery and super powerfull zapper.!!,Battery life is awesome and the zap it delivers is powerfull.It's sturdy...normal racquets that we purchase from the market may not work if it's hit on wall or if it's fall by mistake. This one is Rock!! Works normal even after such incudent.
1017,5,HIT HITTING HOT IN MARKET...,SUPERB QUALITY PRODUCT FROM HIT. MUST FOR EVERYHOME GO FOR IT WITH FULL TRUST... ITS REALLY GOOD ONE TO HAVE.üëç
1018,4,No hanger string,It's nice but it do not have hanger string at the tip of the handle. It may drop down while put on charging..!
1019,5,Awesome,"Product awesome,there were plenty mosquito at our home but the satisfaction i got after killing those is awesome.Cannot express in words, for complete review watch ‚ÄúDeba unboxing‚Äù channel on YouTube you will get complete review."
1020,5,Mosquito Killer,Its perfect for killing mosquitos. Battery life is just awsome. Charge for 3-4 hours and it will last for 5 to 6 days atleast.
1021,4,Very Good Product,"Best one. If anyone wants to buy, can go without hesitation. Since product is new so battery backup is good so far, will see how it goes further. Drawback is only its switch which is very flat, other than that product is very nice."
1022,1,Made in China,I thought this is made in india. But this is made in  China... completely cheated by the manufacturer...
1023,5,Great Product,"Great Product, good packaging, nice instructions and works really well. Looks sturdy. Money well spent"
1024,4,Yet another Chinese made up to Look Indian,My Second swatter from HIT which has broken  down and unable to use.The Plug point assembly starts malfunctioning after a month of use
1025,5,Great Product,not a flimsy bat that is available in most supermarket checkout stations.slight expensive but worth it if you hate mosquitoes and other bugs.
1026,4,Good purchase,Good one but giving 4 star coz the charging pattern is still the old fashioned way. It could have been innovative as the transitional charging method for these racquets has lot of cons.
1027,1,"Worst to buy, don't spend money on it.","Poor product. Doesn't even work for 10 day.Waste of money. Even replacement is also worst, it's already more than 30+days and still showing delivery date pending."
1028,5,"""Hit"" mosqito raquet, review",Very good product. Mosquitoes and other pests shattered to minute pieces.Quick action. I like it.
1029,1,Worst,Batteries dis locate when I open the parcel within one hour it won't work
1030,1,It is not serving the purpose,"It is useless , doesn‚Äôt serve the purpose.You have to hit on the mosquito, but by the time one take it near mosquito, it flies away. Raquate should be such as to attract the mosquito from a distance, then only it can serve the purpose"
1031,4,"As excepted, good one",The best part it has warranty of couple of months and also gives  good charging. It has a blue light to see the object moving in the dark aswell.
1032,1,Very poor battery life,"Even on a full charge, the equipment hardly works for 10-15 minutes. Pathetic performance. No idea how to claim the warranty either."
1033,3,Highly Disappointed.,Battery is not long last. Once we charged for 3 to 4 hours ( as per shown in description from company use direction) not working full day / Night. So that‚Äôs why highly Disappointed.
1034,5,Nice product.,Looks good to me. It has blue light for night mode and to attract mosquitos.
1035,1,Stopped working after 2months.Warranty Initiated.,When it worked it worked well but now after 2 months it stopped working no matter how much you charge it doesn't kill a single mosquito so no point spending 500 rs on this one when you can get one in 100rs otherwise.
1036,1,Worst experience !!!,Purchased week ago... But worst experience working like cheap china model. After charging 2-3 hours... It is hardly working about 20min... After that need to charge..
1037,3,Works fantastic when new but performance deteriorated after 6 months,It worked beyond my expectations when it was new but with time the deteriorated. I didn't went for chinese cheap products and spent extra money for hit thinking it will last long but now I am not sure how long it will work.
1038,1,Don't buy this product..,Waste of money..I am already booking three numbers.. three's are complaint..
1039,5,Long battery life and v.good buit quality,Bought this one a while ago and only charged once sonce then. Maybe I am using it less but but battery life is good and it is of very good built quality also.
1040,1,Misleading description,"Though description says country of origin as India, product box says in as China... Totally disappointed and feel misguided."
1041,3,Misleading Product Information,The sellers are misleading people by mentioning Country Of Origin as India. This product is Made In China!!Amazon should keep a check on this!!
1042,5,Excellent product that kills mosquitoes.,Excellent Quality. Awesome performance. Good battery life and most important it kills mosquitoes.
1043,5,A well made bug zapper,"Well and sturdily made. Excellent at zapping flying mosquitoes, flys, etc.. Very happy with my purchase."
1044,1,Just stopped working!,"The product is very unreliable. It just stopped working within 20 days. The performance was fine while it lasted. However, I am pretty disappointed. Cheaper bats last much longer.I would like to have a refund/replacement if possible."
1045,5,Recommended,Did not want to buy those cheap flimsy mosquito bats so went for this. Very sturdy product. The racket surface is large and it never failed to zap a fly. Have been using since couple of months. Highly recommend.
1046,1,Not reliable & No Warranty & No support from customer care of Godrej - Total cheating,It does not gets turn on. Fully dead within a month.I registered the product in their website for warranty. No response.I contacted service center via email - no reply.I contacted their Toll free - no one picked the call.

Can someone help? Had bought it just a month ago"
1049,5,Best raquet I've ever owned,"Works like a charm, it's sturdy can even play tennis with it.The sound of insects and mosquitoes evaporating from earth is very satisfying"
1050,1,Very much disappointed,HIT Mosquitio bat worked for few days only. Thereafter bat is not working as no mosquito is trapped. Only blue color light is burning. Red colot is not lighting. Is there any possibility to get replacement?
1051,5,Replacement bat sent within week when warranty is claimed after 3 months use,Warranty claim process is very simple and replacement was sent within a week to registered address.
1052,5,very good mosquito bat,"battery lasts longer..just a touch, the mosquito is burnt.. good item"
1053,1,Waste of our valuable money,"I had a bad experience with this product.Not worthy, waste of our valuable money.Even packing also not good.Battery setting inside the bat is detached....battery life is too bad.Totally waste of money."

1061,1,"Please dnt buy,  worst product.","Its not working after 2 uses, not deserve a single star. Don't go on the name of brand."
1062,4,Good,"I was a bit suspicious after reading all the negative reviews, but the product is good."

1064,5,Good racket with warranty,It‚Äôs of good quality and catches mosquito very quickly. It‚Äôs with 6 months warranty and they do replace if u suffer from some issue. Just when you buy please register your product on their website to avail warranty
1065,1,HIT mosquito bat didn't last long,I ordered bat on 7th dec and on 23rd Jan it stopped working. This bat is not worth the price and it wont last long. Choose wisely.

1067,1,Quality is bad,It stop working suddenly.. Charge is full but there is no current flowing. We hardly used it for 2 week only.Can't even replace it now. Please let us know know if there is any chance of replacement.
1068,1,Manufacturing defect,Jusr received the order - The plug socket was not sliding in properly. Didnt try much effort thinking that it may break. Ordered for a replacement. Manufacturing defect.
1069,1,Poor quality and performance,"The quality of the product is too poor, working also average, they have provided the customer service number but it is not working I have mail to customer support but still now I didn't received the replay it is better to go for different product"
1070,5,Must have,"Buying for the second time. Price is increased, this is the only part I don't like."
1071,1,Stopped working after 6 months,Product stopped working exaco after 6 months. Disappointed to see if from a branded product
1072,5,Just go for it.,"The best bat i have used so for, just go for it. Dont spend your money on other bats.The battery life is realy good. With good power."
1073,1,Poor Electronic product,The racket last for only four month . Very pour buildup in interior product. The hit company consentrate on outer body only..It's good to buy for Footpath shop
1074,2,"Good purchase, price slightly higher but if it justifies HIT brand in long run then worth a purchase",So called HIT product has become defective within 1 year of purchase. No use paying higher price for brand HIT when cheaper options are available online
1075,2,I have Amazon invoice so is needs to register vendors site for the warranty?,"Hi, I have purchased this item 21st December,  it was working fine but now there is something wrong in the product not working at all. I want to claim the warranty for this item urgently,  please do the needful."
1076,3,faulty product,"The item did not work at all. There is some broken part inside. I bought it on Amazon' s recommendation, but I have to again order for a new one."
1077,1,Worst battery life,Battery life very bad. Need to charge After every use. It's take  4-5 hours to full charge but after that only 1 hours working then again you need to charge it. You can't change the battery because it's can't replaceable.
1078,4,"Product is good, but issues with warranty website","Unable to register for warranty, as the website provided is not providing OTP for final step of registration."
1079,1,Dead Within Two Weeks,The device has stopped working within two weeks. The link for warranty registration never opened. Stuck with a useless product that has stopped charging. Not expected from a branded product. Local brands last much longer. Don't buy.
1080,4,Effective Mosquito Bat,It is a good product. Very effective against mosquitoes but takes a while to charge. The light is a good and effective feature. My rating for this product would be a good 3.5/5.
1081,5,Worth buying,Very useful product. Easy to use. One time charge will work for 1 week
1082,5,Ergonomics are too good,"Ergonomics of this bat is so good , your success hit ratio is pretty high ...light weight easy to use .. I feel value for money"
1083,5,Hit it before it bite you,"After a month I can say that it's worth. Light in weight than the other available in local market.I think it's serviceable too, because it's having screw holes than others."
1084,1,Not worth the money,The product is defective as the on/off switch does not slide properly and one might break his/her finger. Why are you charging premium price for faulty and inferior quality product?
1085,5,Fabulous product,The battery life is really awesome guys....must go for this without a second thought
1086,5,Quality product,Though it is costly but very nice finishing . Looks very premiuim

1088,1,"Don't buy this, don't waste money on this product",Waste of money don't buy this product. Bad quality plastic. I have raised replacement request. I have received a massage replacement pending from last 4 days.
1089,5,Durable mosquito bat,"I had purchased this at a local store, It's a very durable mosquito bat. All other local mosquito bats I've used have not even come 6 months. This has come for more than year. So purchased one more from Amazon."
1090,5,A good product,This is the third bat we purchased and we‚Äôre a bit skeptical about it. But it‚Äôs holding good. Great battery life and very effective.
1091,5,Best product,Have been using it for 4 months. Its exactly the product i was looking for. Justifies its cost.
1092,5,Excellent quality..,An excellet product. Quality is far superior that those cheap chinese products. Works well.. Worth the money spent

1094,1,Very bad not expected,Only name is branded but not the work because within 3 days it started different types of problems like automatically sparking after powering it even without any mosquito trap..
1095,5,Best Mosquito Racquet,I have used many racquets from ‚Çπ100 to ‚Çπ600 but found that this one is the best and also comes with 6 months warranty although my products never faced any problem. I have purchased 8 units till the date for me and my relatives. Best one go for it.
1096,1,Faulty product received,Recharge pin is not staying at its place. It's too delicate. There is no option to replace this product.
1097,5,Best available in market!,"I have tried many mosquito bats, which run out of life within 6 months or so. This product is definitely an anomaly, it is durable and has immense power. If your home is troubled with mosquitoes, then this is the perfect solution!"
1098,5,A must buy,Very satisfied with the product. It's pretty sturdy and durable. I would like to appreciate the battery life on this product. I have been using it since close to 2 months in a single charge.
1099,1,Waste of Money Better Purchase from Street rather than this,Very Cheap Product The battery was makeing Noise when j Shake the Handel even if I Purchase from the streets or Out Side Station where they sell I  have never come accross such Cheap Quality
1100,4,Durable,"Good battery life, review after using it for little over a month"
1101,5,Warranty good replacement,Like
1102,1,Defective product received,"Received defective product. Waiting for replacement. Checked starting it didn't work, Kept charging for 4hours but still its not working."
1103,5,Worth the money,"I bought one more than an year ago & bought another one recently. The battery life is excellent, I charge once a week. Durable and reliable. Worth the money."
1104,1,Very Bad quality and gets slooled very fast,Other un branded racquets work much better and longer. We have bought 3 racquets of HIT so far and all gave given trouble. Rather buy cheaper unbranded ones.
1105,1,Always getting a defective piece,Why am I getting always a defective piece....something is shaking inside....the plug pin part is not going inside completely after charging. Please send me a good product
1106,1,Total money waste,"Pathetic one stopped working after 2 3 months, even the local ones work longer than this."
1107,5,Good product.,"Good product. Very useful against mosquito, fly and other flying insects. I am satisfied."
1108,3,JUST BUY IT,The product is good .Bye Bye Mosquito time has come. But hard to find the Mosquito once you pick up the bat . Mosquitoes are getting smarter nowadays.
1109,4,Good one among all other companies,Good plastic material.Look goodAnd design all right.Easy to use
1110,5,Best one,Everything is perfect even after 5 months of use. Charge stays for days together.
1111,3,Power Button was falling apart!,The power button slider was loose and held together with cellophane tape. Had to take the bat apart to fix the power button slider.
1112,1,Battery is worst,Battery backup is very very poor it is useless in 1 month because we have to charge it for more than 8 hours and it is not run for atleast 8 minutes.Worst product because manufactured in chinaPlease work for its battery backup
1113,5,Just go for it,"Awesome product.Very reliable.Not a single problem yet.Easy to use.Battery backup is very good.Value for money.Just go for it ,rather than any other cheap,chinese product."
1114,1,Not satisfied,I have purchased two rackets but It stops working within one month.Unable to claim warranty.Waste of money.
1115,5,Good and Durable,"Good product. Less weight. It has a blue light, which attracts the mosquitoes towards light or makes them visible in corners."
1116,1,Stopped working in 4 months.,Stopped working in 4 Months.  Written to the warranty department. No response.  I never expected this from a reputed company.
1117,5,Very high quality bat in the market,Very good quality. Kills mosquito instantly. Go fot it. Its a brand.
1118,5,Very robust and ergonomically designed product,Robust and ergonomic construction .Very good and handy product. Only issue is instead of keeping button press  to get net charge only switch ON and off button would be better
1119,1,"Do not buy this,",It stopped working in 3 Days after receiving. Its really bad quality product
1120,1,Poor quality,Damaged within a week. Better products available in market for lesser price.
1121,1,It worked for 6 months,The racket stopped working after 6 months. Hugely disappointed with the product
1122,3,Switch is not working properly,I am facing the switch issue on this bat ... Not able to switch off... So if we charge it's drain a full battery ... Cannot works after at the time of need. I put this charge for 6 hrs in the morning.. not able to switch off... If I keep it
1123,5,Product Quality and Battery Life,This is a great product. You hold it in your hands and instantly u know this is not a cheap product. One charge last for a week. Kills all insects instantly. The blue light is also too good. Highly recommended for all.
1124,4,Gud racket,Gud racket but battery weakens after a year. Price is bit high.
1125,3,Worst seller send defective and used by other operaon sent,First time I purchased it's good second time sent defective product it looks like used by some one
1126,5,Best buy,"I can't expect better. It does it's job perfectly,  using it for about 2 years now."
1127,5,Best quality Product - Worth to Buy,"Best mosquito killer racket ,  I ever used  - ... you can purchase without any second thought .."
1128,1,Worst product.,"It's not been used for 3 days, product got defective and not working despite fully charged. I suggest not to buy this one not even single star"
1129,1,Worst product and and don't expect warranty,Battery drain in 5 mins. Claimed warranty but that was worst than previous one.Now calling for more than a month but they are telling it would not be delivered
1130,5,Goof,Good as far as I have used...should wait to know abt battery....I had recharged to only once and been using it for almost 2 months sparingly.
1131,1,Stopped working within 3 days of purchase,Bought this product on 19 August and within 3 days of usage it stopped workingNo customer support for warranty of 6 monthPathetic product and worst service by Godrej Hit.
1132,1,Bekaar product h,"Pathetic product, used it for 3-4 days after that its not charging. In market such products are available on one third of its price and are more durable. Strongly recommend not to buy this"
1133,2,Not Worthy,A Local brand bat works far better. battery life is not good at all .. Giving this review after using it for few months
1134,5,Nice product,Good product battery long lasting it kill mosquito nicely and light wait
1135,1,Most Worst Product !!!,Most Worst Product !!!I recommend to not buy.No battery life and won't work often.Can replace it and get other one......Really fed up of this product......
1136,5,Perfect,I've tried other mosquito killing bats which are available in the market but this is something really strong and nice. Worth every penny spent and you can buy it without having any second thoughts.
1137,3,Battery concern,Battery life is main concernedAdd something that battery doesn't get effected during chargingMany don't know how long to charge
1138,2,Broken after four months of use,Worked well while it lasted and now not working after four months of use. Recharges last long but unfortunately not the product itself.
1139,1,Delivery of damaged item,The product mosquito bat delivered seems to be a damaged item  earlier returned by some other buyer.  This was not expected from Amazon
1140,1,It been stop working with in 20day after buying,Product is good but the one sended toMe was not working properly and stop working with in a3 week after buying and returning policy also not availableAfter 3 week I wanted to return this one it is in warranty for 6months
1141,5,Superb product! Value for money.,"Great product! Have been using this for more than a month and absolutely no issue so far. Once charged, battery lasts for more than 4-5 days."
1142,2,Too heavy,Is too heavy and hence difficult to use against agile mosquito
1143,1,Don‚Äôt buy,Barely worked for 2 months. It‚Äôs better to buy other local / imported.
1144,5,Very good quality,Veri good quality mosquito kill racket from very known brand. Works very well .
1145,1,Useless product,"Did not last even for a week. Led indicator shows its getting charged. But when I turn it on, it does not work. Better to buy local product from nearby store. They at least last for 6 months. Don't go by HIT brand. I fell into their trap."
1146,1,"Product was not working, Amazon Should Test before shipped.","I got it with NO working condition, I tried to use it but it was internally defected and Amazon did not tested it before deliver, Amazon shipped me defected item which I returned back and moved to Flipkart."
1147,5,It can even kill other bugs...,"One of the best products....with this I can kill each n every Mosquito in my home..rather than using repellents n coils ,this is better...go for it...üòçIf you get angry on anyone just give them a shock with this batüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
1148,5,Best mosquito racket out there!!!!,"Very good quality and efficacy in killing flying insects. Blue light makes it look nice while using ! Sturdy structure, solid & strong body with a firm grip. Best product of its type ! üëç"
1149,2,Waste of Money,In the starting it was working smoothly but it stopped working within a month. Most of the wire got damaged and twisted within a month of use and that is irrepairable
1150,1,Fake Product,The product i got and the one showing was completely differentThe product was not workingBattery was not taking any chargeIt was a fake product in a original box as the product was not even fitting in the box
1151,1,No response from manufacturer warrenty,This damaged in 14th day of purchase. And no response from the amazon and the manufacturer as per Claus. Very dissatisfied product.
1152,5,Killer product for mosquito,As soon as i move my bat mosquito goes awayI nearly kill 200 mosquitoIts keeps battery for 4daysAfter killing average 600 mosquitoBatery backup is good
1153,5,Definitely above average quality,I have used many bats. This definitely is better than the others.
1154,5,Best mosquito racquet ever,This product is great. It's from a reliable brand so durability is not a problem. It works smoothly and is really helpful.
1155,5,Unnecessary packaging for a simple product which is already packaged well by the manufacturer.,"The product is fine, but is Amazon planning to ruin the planet ?Why does a mosquito bat require so much of packaging ? The mosquito bat already comes in a solid sturdy box packaging. Amazon has packed it further with a larger cardboard box. Why ?"
1156,1,Performance not satisfying,"The product is not as expected, very disappointed. It stopped working in 2 uses. We ordered Hit brand hoping it to be as good as the brand name, but probably it was a wrong decision or maybe we received a bad quality product."
1157,3,The button has design issues,"I dont know if we got a defective item or not, but the button is very deep in the bat which makes it diddicult for people with short nails to use them. They could have changed that."
1158,5,Great build quality and good product,Have been using it for past 1 week. The plastic quality is great. You wont feel it's any low grade plastic. I am not sure if the led in it is doing any good. But a worth buying mosquitoe bat
1159,3,Inconsistent performance,Occasionally it does not work. You cannot tell when it will or it will not work. Pretty incosistent.
1160,2,No warranty,Bought this expensive racquet so that I could get a warranty as there is no return policy. Unfortunately cant register using the QR code provided. Tried twice:(
1161,3,"Good,Go for it.","Product is good.Working well though it is used for last 2days.But when received,too many scraches seen all over the body of the racquet.This disappoint me.Overall ok."
1162,4,fly swatter,Better than Chinese swatters available in market. Lightweight. Battery life is good. it has a blue light inbuilt
1163,1,Not working after 3 days of purchase,"Not working after 3 days of purchase. It‚Äôs a second hand product. When highlighted to delivery boy, He said that the package is fine. Pls do something, we expect right n genuine product from Amazon. Pls take some action this"
1164,1,Didn‚Äôt last even a week,Kindly don‚Äôt buy it from Amazon.. as they failed to provide the invoice details as a result it cudnt be repaired or changed.Big big disappointment
1165,4,Good Product,Light is blue. Rest is okay. Good product from Godrej. It help to keep good sleep without mosquito.
1166,3,Highly priced,Not effective against mosquitoes!  To improve upon the quality rather than Show
1167,5,Super hit product from HIT,Very good product from HITInstead of buying duplicates in market for 200-300/-. Go for this it is durable
1168,1,Horrible product,The product has stopped working within 1.5 months. I bought it assuming that it is from Godrej brand and it will last. Horrible product. Please do not waste your money and pay any premium based on brand.
1169,2,Recommend do not buy,"Only thing i like its Easy to use, but then later it stops working after few months.. If you just need for few months then go for it or its waste of money.."
1170,3,Not good as expected,Not good as expected led light is not bright as expected and also when mosquito is trapped it  gets pushed back only after one hit so dont die
1171,4,"Well Made Product, Definitely A Good Buy. But Not Too Sturdy.","Product seems to be well made. Liked the blue light embedded into the handle.But, it's not all that sturdy. It fell once by a distance of a meter and now the wire mesh dented and somethings seems to be lose inside of the handle."
1172,1,Don't buy,Bad
1173,5,Good & Effective Mosquito Racket,No complain. It is working very well and effective product.
1174,5,"The best, reliable, well made Mosquito Racquet","The best, reliable, well made Mosquito Racquet.I've not been able to test the battery life but it's very durable, well made, sturdy and kills mosquito on touch.Definately recommend."
1175,2,Not very durable.,Not durable. Battery wire joint at solder came out after 06 month of use.
1176,5,Best bat for mosquito,Its catch mosquito few seconds and blue light is added advantage it's working perfect to catch mosquitoI am very much thanks to Amazon for delivery product in raining on delivery
1177,4,Worth to buy,Extremely usefulDurable material qualityCharging is slowBlue light feature is added benefit
1178,5,A racquet for ultimate relief üòÖ,The product is made by Godrej and one can understand the built quality. It‚Äôs like the apple of mosquito racquets. Almost killed a 100 mosquitoes with it. Just day 1 üòÇ! Very happy and satisfied with it.
1179,1,Useless,Useless as after couple of days of delivery battery comes out nd started making noise nd sometimes working sometimes not so returned better suggestion go with local nd buy two same resonse atleast those will work
1180,4,"Works well against most tiny insects, but the switch quality can be better","It works well against mosquitoes and other such tiny insects. If anything, the switch quality can improve."
1181,5,Thanks Godrej,"If someone is looking for better product than those available in Big bazar or Dmart, then this is the one."
1182,5,Get this,"Get  it even if you don't have mosquitos, I use to to scare kids üòè"
1183,5,Good Product,"Good brand Hit company product .... Working still, about a year already.... But battery capacity is a bit reduced from the level when new"
1184,1,"It doesn't get charged, so of no use... Wanted money.","This is second time I bought this product and I feel I wasted my money,  this doesn't get charged for use. Feeling cheated badly üò¢"
1185,2,Good look but poor performance,It did not hit and trap the mosquitoes. Thus I had to return it.
1186,4,One month work then not function,Battery life is poorto hold powerfor 2 hours only with daily 8 hours chargeGood frame designIt is not functional after a monthIt should be returned to supplier
1187,1,Damaged,"Not working,I returned it ."
1188,1,Worked for 2 days only,If product not working then how can I talk about such things?Product has stopped working.. would like to return it .. but packaging thrown away
1189,1,Fraud product,"Faulty product, did not work for 5 days also , after charging the circuit got blown and the racquet was useless. The warranty claim is aslo base less . Godrej customer care doest not revert. Total waste of money"
1190,2,Not that good,U have to often charge it for proper functioning...it does not have long battery life
1191,5,üëè,Nice & effective against mosquito . Good battery life . With warranty . Cool purchase
1192,1,. It should be mentioned where warranty given.,I opted for this seeing the price with 6 months warranty. Hopefully it will work.The condition on warranty not mentioned on order details. You have to register within 10 days
1193,1,You will never get the warranty.,Bat worked fine for 30 days. After that it stopped working. I have claimed for warranty but no response from Godrej.  Don't just be moved with the warranty given. You will never get it.
1194,4,Highly effective,"It‚Äôs a home essentials because mosquitoes can create problems, it‚Äôs heavy duty and easy to use , a single charge can go for days ."
1195,1,Not working,The product stopped working even after charging it for a while. The product has good quality plastic over it but the inner mechanics are very bad I must say I bought it in August and it stopped working by the beginning of September.
1196,1,Power pins don't slide out,Utterly flimsy. The power pins don‚Äôt pop out because the plastic piece that moves them is a millimeter thin and broke on the first attempt. See the broken piece in the picture.
1197,1,3 months lifetime bat,"Worked like a charm .... Only for few months!!! Within 3 months the buttons were not responding, we need to press it hard, to make the bat operational.It won't last for a year."
1198,1,Very bad quality,After one use the battery is not getting charged. Used hardly for 12 days. Very disappointed and dissatisfied
1199,4,Good and effective product.,"Using it for past 4-5 months, the product is very good and solves the purpose. The battery life is great !!"
1200,1,Just 2 days no sparking,I have purchased Anti musquito racquet on 4th Dec (2 days before). Now sparkling not working if muquito has touched the racquet also. All the light iAnd indications are working but no spark. Because of that muquito not killed.
1201,3,Battery doesnt last,The battery of the product doesnt last 10.15 minutes otherwise a sturdy pack
1202,1,Short lived with no juice,Did not last for even 9 months. Battery doesn't last for more than a day. Not worth the money. Bought it only for the brand but now I feel very disappointed.
1203,5,Good purchase,It is almost an year of use. working very well. I am satisfied with this purchase and use.
1204,5,Zaps mosquitoes in an instant.,Battery life ends after three days of continuous zapping.
1205,5,Great Product !!,Excellent product !! Best mosquito racquet I have used so far. Battery life is very good so u do not have to charge it every now and then. Go for it.
1206,5,"Good quality, lives upto it's name","Very sturdy, long lasting power on single charge say it works atleast 15 days on single charge, blue light torch,"
1207,5,Value for money product.,Good quality of product nice and strongand very powerful .
1208,5,Quality of the product is good,I am using this product from 2 months its good you can also kill little large insects with it. Overall it is a good product to go with as it has 6months of warranty
1209,5,Good,There is no issue after 1 month of use. Products look durable and best so far at this price. Let's see how long its battery work.
1210,1,Not good,"The product belongs to great company , but not up to the mark after charging for 4 hours it gives us 2minute's of out come while chasing mosquitoes.I hope this is worse product... Please don't think to buy it"
1211,1,Quality is poor,Worst product .....exachge service is vry bad..they don't exchage my product under warranty....disappointed...
1212,5,"Quality, life and worthy product","Very good quality product, long lasting battery life, and works really well. Worth the money"
1213,3,I m totally disappointed ...,When it's new battery is working quite good in 3 to 4 days but now it's discharging automatically don't know why ???  Same like Chinese product we are getting in local stores ... I thought this will be better product but it's same like local product too much disappointed...
1214,1,Not good,Battery doesn't last long. Doesn't kill mosquito efficiently
1215,5,Satisfied with this Product.,"Liked the design, compactness and small light attached to body - which made this product very nice."
1216,5,Worth purchase,Good one to kill the mosquitoes and it lasts long once charged
1217,1,HIT just hit me,I had choosen it for the name HIT as Indian product but it hit me. Within 7 days it is out of order. Waste of money
1218,1,"Don't know how, but received an used one.",Felt like I had received an used one. Box inside too was open while I opened packing.1. Received with wear and tear2. Doesn't workWill buy if offline after checking rather buying online and returning.
1219,5,Review after 4 months usage,Battery is unstable and post charging for 2 hours battery lasts to 2 mins only.
1220,1,Slide button,I received the product with the yellow slide button fallen off in the packing case. Otherwise the product is OK.
1221,5,Good product. Go for it.,The product is ergonomic. Easy to use. Good product. The blue light found useless to me.
1222,1,Poor customer service and poor product,"I had purchased this racket in May 2020. Within 1 month, the product is not working. I raised a complaint with Hidden cp website and company email also. Even after 1 week no acknowledgement forget about resolution. That is the problem with Indian companies."
1223,1,Bad quality,Received a damaged product.... I noticed there is an issue with the product(unable to open charging NOB) when I am keeping charging for the racket. Really a bad quality from HIT.
1224,1,The worst Product from a reputed company,"Simply it doesn't work, you can't kill even a smallest mosquito because the required current doesn't generated which kills the smallest bug/mosquito. Worst... Worst.... they should be banned to Trade on Amazon"
1225,1,It seems it output power is less.,Not killing mosquito properly as other racquet do maybe due to poor battery or improper circuit. It should be checked before selling.I have used hit racquet earlier also but this one is not working properly.
1226,1,Bat stopped charging after 2 months,Bat is not maintaining the charge and we are not able to use the bat. I was expecting HIT Anti Mosquito Racquet would be better than any other brand in the market but was not very happy. Hope it will be a better product in future.
1227,3,Average product,"Its an okay product but expensive.Also the blue light that is supposed to attract mosquitoes does not do its job, doesn't even attract a single mosquito. LOL"
1228,5,Sturdy and powerful,The build quality is sturdy and spark also stuns and even burns the mosquito depending on its size. Nice product if somebody wants to avoid fumes of mosquito coil.
1229,4,Very useful,"I got this product Just a few days ago it's very useful product battery life is good ,sturdiness is same time hit same time miss, high quality plastic very durable"
1230,5,Branded is always better hence proved,Very good finish and can kill mosquitoes with ease.I'll say it can even kill crocodiles as it has so good finish
1231,5,Good Product,"Excellent product, but charging pin should be more sturdy, that's the only weakness of this product."
1232,1,Worst product,I had to return the product as there was a metal ring trapped and touching the net. As soon as switch is pressed it used to flicker even without mosquitos.
1233,5,Value for Money,This is the second time I'm buying the same product. The earlier one lasted close to two years and broke because of accidental damage.
1234,1,Defective product,"I used it only on 2-3 days. Once the battery got discharged, I tried charging the product multiple times but it did not get charged. Useless product or the seller defrauded me with a defective piece."
1235,4,Hit mosquito killer bat is really a BIG HIT !!,Very nice and durable product. Battery life is good and if u charge it regularly it will surely serve you for longer time.
1236,5,The best bat available in the market,In all respects it's good.  Surprised to see some bad reviews regarding this product. I disagree with their claims. I am totally satisfied with its functioning.  I recommended to some of my friends.
1237,4,Best mosquito bat !!,Best in segment !! Its powerful and very useful when there is lot of mosquito problem in our home
1238,1,Third class product by godrej,"Third class product from Godrej üò°, cheap quality made in china ,not so durable , instead buy nippo mosquito bat"
1239,5,Wow - wonderful product,"I have never seen this much perfection in mosquito bat.. Great work team.. Superb design.I got this product on the same. I am very much impressed for the package, instructions etc. Superb.. Worth."
1240,5,Very nice amazing product,First product was not worked but they have a warranty card I applied for warranty and I got another product and it's has fastest delivery and the battery life charging 5 hours and using a week very nice stable to take the product
1241,5,good,good onefed up with low cost ones.. happy with this
1242,5,Best quality,Much better than the cheap chinese products available in the local market.
1243,5,Good product. works well with Flies too,Good product. works well with Flies too
1244,4,Go for it,"Nice product, worth the money but asking to register for warranty is so old school."
1245,1,Not reliable stopped working,Stopped working after a month please don‚Äôt waste money on this go for local ones
1246,1,"Along with battery life, durability is as much important",Battery life wasn't enough for even 2 hours. Battery stopped getting charged in about one and a half months time. Very poor quality.
1247,1,Got a defective piece which wont charge,We have used this for few days as initial charge lasted longer than 15 days. Right from the beginning we havent seen any led light up and thought there is an issue with the led. Turns out the charging mechanism is completely defective. Didnt expected this from HIT.
1248,1,"The newly received item not working, opted for return item","The newly received item not working, opted for return item and the return courier guy is giving false info that door is closed for pick up. So I am stuck with this useless product and no refundNo option in amazon site to escalate the issue"
1249,2,Bad battery backup,"I am not much satisfied with this product, as i read reviews, charging time is so long but battery backup is very bad... its looks verymuch attractive, but work on battery backup."
1250,5,Much better than the local one,I have been using this for 2 months now...the quality is much better than the one's available in local market.It is sturdy and has a good battery life
1251,5,finally found a solution,going good. Battery back up need to be taken care of. one can go for it in this price
1252,1,Useless fake product,"The buttons of the Racquet are loose and are coming out. It's a made in china product. It will not last long. Also, it's useless, not even a single mosquito is killed ."
1253,3,Work on light direction,White light would have been much better than the blue one. Light direction is not comfortable.
1254,5,Forget all those low price Chinese products and switch to hit.,"material, finish, battery life everything is good.works good. Better than the low price non brand product."
1255,5,"Long battery life, powerful.","Very good battery life, with one charge can use for days together. Power is also good and handy."
1256,5,Sturdy & Durable,Very sturdy and durable. It is working fine also battery life is good.
1257,1,Stopped working within 2 months and no way to claim warranty.SCAM!!.,The racquet has stopped working within 2 months. Need to apply for warranty. Don't know if it is really covered under warranty or not. Many cheap local brands have more durability than this fake branded racquet.
1258,1,Low quality product,"Died within a month of use. Would not recommend, waste of money"
1259,5,Very good quality,prefer this than other no brands. the quality and design is well thought out.
1260,2,Not a Durable product,"It worked fine when it arrived but within the first 10 days of usage, the led which lights up while charging the racquet suddenly stopped working........ unable to figure out whether its charging or not."
1261,1,Bad product,It's not working and if the product is not replaced we will make a fir because I had I had selected the return and replacement policy on 28 of December and now you are saying tha return and replacement policy date has been ended
1262,2,Not durable,Stopped working 15 days and claiming warranty is a headache because it takes 15 to 20 days for them to pickup and send a new one.
1263,5,Good customer service,After 10 days of usageVery poor battery- after 8 hrs of charging - not workingClaimed warranty - godrej issued new piece in 5 daysNow working good
1264,4,Good,"Good product ,strong body unlike local or chinese  racquet with good battery life"
1265,1,Not working and warranty not covering faults,"I used for 3 days and now not working, warranty also not covering if product is not working. Its worst product ever I bought/seen. Stop making fool to customers."
1266,1,Bad,Looks good but if doesn‚Äôt work and kill mosquitoes then it‚Äôs just a racket without any use
1267,1,I want Replacement of this racket..it‚Äôs not working yet..it‚Äôs on warranty.,This product has 6 months warranty...I buy it 2 months back through amazon..But It‚Äôs not working now..I want replacement..How can I get this .plz replace it.
1268,3,Quality is good but torch missing,Quality is good but torch missing. Is expensive over what others are offering. Should not be more then Rs 250.
1269,5,Product IS as described in the product description. Good One!!,The product behavior is same as described in the product description and I haven't faced any problem till now.
1270,1,Stopped working in 1 month.,Very bad experience from the brand. (Not sure if it's a genuine product from HIT). Even the bat i purchase from the streets for rs.150 last longer
1271,5,Very High Quality and Build.. worth the penny,Very High Quality and very durable. The battery is very powerful and kills mosquitoes instantly..
1272,5,Bye bye mosquitos ü¶ü,Very useful and reliable product. This product is much better than the other  mosquito racquet available in the market.
1273,4,good,branded is anyday better than than a cheap chinamaal :P
1274,1,Very poor battery life,"Very poor battery life and in less than 2 months with paltry usage, the product had become redundant. Very unhappy with the product."
1275,3,Not lasting more than 6 months,The product stopped working within 6 months and I claimed warranty. But the replacement product also didn't last more than 3 months.
1276,5,Nice product,I think it's the best amongst all the  other products available now in the market
1277,1,Not a good product,Not sure if they programmed it such way that after 6 months it will stop working..my friends and neighbors are using the local one and they are using it for more than year now and it still working
1278,5,Best mosquito bat in the market,"A battery life of upto 10 days on daily use, when charged for 6 to 8 hours once. Incredibly sturdy as it has fallen on the floor from a height a good number of times. Kills mosquitoes efficiently."
1279,1,Faulty pieces second time,Just dead pieces shipped twice. It used to be ok last year but became disfunctional quickly. Cheap Chinese do betterment
1280,5,Best mosquito killer,"Very strong product, easy to handle and very effective"
1281,4,India Brand...WHICH is #1 for me.,Ok so far...Go for it..Had enough of no name spurious brands...
1282,1,Battery problem,"Battery life is not good,in warranty claim,can not pick up the call from the service center. Godrej customer service is very worst. Amazon please replace or repair the product. I purchased the mosquito bat on 9th March 2020. Distributer could tail."
1283,2,Defective within a month's time,"Defective within a month's time of purchase , now I can not return as well ."
1284,1,"Not worth spending rs 400, just as any other chinese racket",The racket worked well for first 4 months. Tried contacting customer care for warranty but no response. Any chinese racket of rs 100-200 will also work the same
1285,1,Plz don't buy it It's just trash,Product is overpriced and it only worked for 1 month and charging takes a long time and dosent long lastProduct is cheaply built and it's overpricedOn the time of delivery box was badly damaged and Product was used
1286,1,Not working.,After 3 days usage not working. There is no service centre number location available in website also. This is my first experience from Amazon. The product infrastructure is very good. But good for nothing.
1287,5,Beautiful packaging!,"Haven't started using it but really like the packaging. It's a good quality cardboard with proper directions to use on it. If packaging is given this importance, I'm sure the product would be really great."
1288,5,So far so good,Pretty good product. It is a bit pricey though.Works well ... Good job to HIT for the product.
1289,4,Serves the purpose greatly,The product electrocutes the mosquitoes and other little bugs or unwanted pest. Sometimes little too much when stuck in its net
1290,1,Stopped working in 2 days,"It worked for 10 to 12 days and after that it stopped, evwn though it charges, it doesn't work"
1291,1,don't waste your money,stopped working after 3 months. better to buy local mosquito bat at low cost. waste of money..
1292,4,Not working after 15 days,Not working after 15 days...only blue light shown...not killing mosquito
1293,5,Best mosquito hitter,"Sturdy built body with ABS plastic is just phenomenol. Never seen a Mosquito racquet working this perfect. Good battery backup, instruction display, led light performance and high voltage destruction mesh makes it stand out from other brands."
1294,3,Highly priced product.... quality is poor comparing to cost.,Highly priced product .. got it for Rs 549 .. build quality is poor .... Got the replaced product which is having scratches and look used; however kept it as I wanted to use it on the same day.
1295,1,It never killed a mosquito,It never killed a mosquito  Hence returned the same
1296,4,Good product. White led would've made it perfect!,Overall quality is good. Battery life is good. Have charged only a couple of times in the last one month.However the blue led is useless to spot mosquitoes in the dark. A bright white led should've been given instead.
1297,1,Not good at all after 1 month stop working as like other Chinese products,I purchased 2 month ago that times it's work good as like other work but now it's just a showpiece battery fully charged but no working and customer service is uselessToll free number not working. What to do I don't know.
1298,5,Very good,Very good insect killer.durability is better than other mosquito killer racket
1299,1,Recharging not working recharge red light not working with in25days replace request,It is used for mosquote killing at my bed side.So far no fall occurred. With in 25days the battery chargeing is not working.The charge indicator light is not glowing. This Hit mosquito killing racqute has 6month waranty against manufacturing defect. Please replace with new one.
1300,5,Better than the Chinese made,"By the best mosquito racket, much better than the cheaper Chinese made rackets. Very good battery life and power."
1301,5,Good quality,It's much better in terms of quality than local ones. Also is realtively light weight.
1302,3,"Battery Issues, Sometimes not Strong enough to Kill Flies",Battery doesn't show Full Charging. Not able to identify whether its undercharge because torch is working but flies despite sitting on it not getting killed.
1303,5,Awesome product,A good product from godrej built quality of the product is nice for the money paid it's worth it I would suggest to shell out few more rupees to get a good quality product.
1304,1,Don't buy,"I buyed bat in May , I'm not tested weather it's work or not due to strongly believed on Amazon products. But when I opened bat it's not working properly even one day, believing Amazon products is my only mistake"
1305,1,"It sucks from 1st week, thats all.","It is the worst product, all parts r loose and lot of manufacturing defects, the company is not going to update that as consumers are buying it blindly just by seeing the brand name HIT. That is the saddest part."
1306,1,Quality,"Poor product complaint after one month, there is no customer care or Service support .. strongly recommend for avoid this type of products from godrej"
1307,5,Awesome!,Excellent!! Super sturdy & effective. Apart from mosquitoes it even kills house & fruit flies!! Very happy with my purchase.
1308,5,Incorrect amazon description,"Product is made in india , amazon description is incorrect"
1309,1,Stopped working in 20 days,"Built is fine, battery life is fine but it stopped working (basically it does not spark, perhaps wiring issue)."
1310,5,DID NOT LAST EVEN 3 MONTHS,"IT ABSOLUTELY STOPPED WORKING AFTER 2 AND HALF MONTHS. CHARGED IT MULTIPLE TIMES AND TRIED, THE RED LIGHT GLOWS, YET DOESN'T KILL ANY MOSQUITOS. EVEN LOCAL PRODUCTS WORK LONGER THAN THIS."
1311,2,Godrej hit bat after months,"I am writing this after 5 months 28 days, the bat stopped working within warranty period."
1312,5,Very good product,A good product overall. The battery life is good. It's sturdiness and durability is good as well.
1313,4,Good durable product,Very good product works as per my expectation.It is very different from cheap Chinese ones.
1314,5,Good battery life regular use 3-4 days,Like it very much..using it for 3 months.battery life is good..charging good..powerful to kill mosquitos..led feature is awesome..no doubt purchase it
1315,5,Great product,Superb product and great build quality. On time delivery by amazon.
1316,4,Nice product,Good product by Hit to get rid of nagging mosquitoes
1317,5,Works really great!,"I think it is one of the best bug killer I have ever used. If you are fed up of mosquitos in your home, you should buy it. It works like a charm and it also  has a good battery life!"
1318,1,Battery life is very poor. Sparking even in switch off,Submitted request for replacement. 6 days gone but still not done. Defected product has delivered. Sparking even when switch has turned off. Not safe if kids are there in your house.
1319,1,Not good,The item I received was different from that of the image shown in the listing. It sometimes work. Needs constant charging. I wouldn't recommend buying. Hunter is way better.
1320,5,"Good product, 6 months warranty is promising","Good product, 6 months warranty is promising"
1321,5,"Good product, value for money.","Item is as shown in picture, works really well, takes less time for charging."
1322,1,Second hand product given.,"In the first order, I got a damaged product and in the second order i got a second hand product with scratches on it, doesn't work properly. May be it has been used before. Even the packet wasn't sealed. So unprofessional."
1323,3,Dont go for it,Battery is not so good.Not worth 400 aboveBetter take local 200 mosquito bats
1324,5,Best mosquito bat,Awesome battery life this one time investment can save you from purchasing multiple less durable chinese mosquito bats
1325,1,Switch Burton's life isn't good enough for this price.,Life of the product is not enough for this price. it is not durable and much more expensive than other such products available in the market.
1326,2,What matters is the battery life. But dude ain't got it.,I saw the reviews & bought one. The company claims a month of working with one charge. But that's a dupe.  It hardly takes 2-3 days to drain the whole battery life.
1327,2,Not recommend,Not recommend as it started malfunctioning in a week. It continuously makes noise if switched off whether there is an insect on it or not.  Wakes everyone up if have to use at night. Really disappointed this being a Hit product.
1328,5,A very satisfied product,Value for money. Battery life is very good. Perfect function.
1329,2,not working within a week,ordered two. one of them is not charging already. questionable quality
1330,1,Do not invest in this product,"Would warn everybody against buying this product. Mosquitoes are having a free run of my home, while the bat which incidentally needs 8 hours of charging, is highly useless. Please don't waste your money on this product"
1331,1,Nonworking product for 3 times price of product which is sold. Worse quality than Chinese product,It hasn‚Äôt been working since day 2. I haven‚Äôt got time to call customer care. As I need to spend time to find out the number and call within 9-5 pm during weekdays which isn‚Äôt possible for me to do as we are busy during week days
1332,3,Durability,Effective for hitting the insects. But stopped working only fir a month. Fir the money spent and from a well known company it should be more durable
1333,5,Go for it.üëç,Durable quality of both the body and wiring. Quite effective in killing mosquitoes üëçüëç
1334,1,Stopped working after 3 months,The product lasted for three months and stopped working. I brought this looking at the ratings but please don't fool yourself with that. Tried contacting their customer service and like this racket it ain't working too.
1335,1,Stopped working in two months,It has stopped working in two months. I want a replacement. When will I get it?
1336,1,Bad Choice,Battery is poor. Discharging every day. And not working compare to other brands
1337,1,No good,"Doesn‚Äôt work as promised, try to register for warranty, been trying for 5days, absolute crap"
1338,1,Not durable.,The power button is so filmsy that it will break at a couple of touches. To replace it customer service will ask you to search in Google how to get the in-warranty product replaced.
1339,3,Stopped charging after 3 months,Item is good. Long battery life. Bought on 1st Oct 2019. In 3 months the battery is not charging and charging indicator is not on. With Godrej can replace or rectify the same.
1340,4,3 star,This product would have been best if the battery life last more than 2 days
1341,5,Working well,Bought it a month ago. Working well. Battery life is also good.
1342,4,Nice first impressions,first it looks really awesome than cheap 100 rs rackets I rewed this after 1 month and Man !! That's hot that's hott really durable and really good I opened it and the circuit was actually pretty savage
1343,1,Worst product is the least comment,Worst product.  battery discharges in no time. Highly disappointed as it serves no purpose.  I lost money.  Plus need to go repeat buy of some other product.  I request Amazon not to entertain such bad products on its prestigious platform.
1344,5,Very good product,Very good quality. Battery life is good. Kills almost all mosquito and flies. No pollution.
1345,1,Big name...... quality not so big..,"First received product is defective. When returned, another product received is of low quality. Returned again."
1346,5,Fantastic Product,Great product have been using it for several months and does the job brilliantly well. Easy to charge and does the job brilliantly well....
1347,1,Warranty should be one month,"It has stopped working in one month, Amazon sells but no information of where and how to get service support, they should introduce service window, IN INDIA CUSTOMERS ARE TREATED AS BEGGARS."
1348,1,It's better to purchase any local racquest than this branded.,"It's stopped working within 2-3 months and there is catch in warranty... That is after the purchase you've to register this racquet within some days to get the warranty.So, I left with this rubbish racquet and cannot do anything."
1349,1,Not working.,"The Light gets ON but, the racket doesnt kill any mosquito. Faulty item delivered.Amazon customer care has conveyed inability to help and asked to claim warranty independently with manufacturer."
1350,5,Good,Used it for 10 days. Good product with a warranty.
1351,1,After two month of use the racket is not working at all.,The lights are working the current is not flowing on the panels but.Very Bad experience with such a reputed brand.
1352,5,Review,"Battery life could have been better. However, the build quality is very good as I've smashed it on the floor several times trying to HIT mosquito but nothing really happened to the body or the internals. Recommended buy."
1353,1,Non working product,It is not working at all. The mesh is damaged. I thought a famous brand product would be good to use but that wasn‚Äôt the case.
1354,1,Stop working not able to claim warranty,Have purchased it but after couple of months it stop working now when I claim the warranty nothing is happening pathetic customer service ans support by godrej as a brand.
1355,5,Very very good product. A must buy to kick mosquitoes out of your house,"Happy to purchase this product, battery life is amazing. Charging the batter as per the instructions manual has worked out wonders. Love it :)"
1356,3,Not worth 500!,It was only good the first 15-20 days... Post that the battery drains out within 30mins even after charging for3-4 hours. Not at all worth the price.
1357,1,Very bad quality. Just worked for 12 days,"Not charging and working. Now I could not return also. Waste of moneyInteresting thing is after registering for warranty, when I press claim warranty button the page does not open at all."
1358,3,Sent returned product?,I have a doubt if the Seller has sent returned product. Hit logo was peeled off when taken out. It doesn't looks new for sure.
1359,1,Worst Buy Ever,"It is totally waste of money, it doesn't work in most of the time. Quality of build is good but is lacking in productivity. So, I would suggest you to buy racket from local market which is cheap and has good performance"
1360,5,Go for refund not replacement n do not order again,"Product is superb as their brand name but stopped getting charged after a week.  On replacement got a duplicate product which was not working. Ordered a new one, got a used product neatly packed without a warranty slip."
1361,5,Good,It's good.I will review it after 6 months.
1362,5,Good product,Good product.....as expected... value for money.
1363,1,Waste of money,Battery backup gone with in 2 months of use. Always keep on charge and it stops working after killing 1 or 2 mosquitoes.
1364,1,"one of the worst product,","i am trying to contact Customer support for last 2 months no use,Call center number /Support email doesnt work.Bat doesnt hold charge within 1 hr it discharges useless bat. within 2 weeks issuesAmazon should verify the warranty centers before selling"
1365,1,Worst product.,Worst product. Go for Hunter. I claimed three times warranty. Hit Customer care doesn't care about it. Then call Amazon customer care they told me call only manufacturer. Good partnership Amazon. Worst customer service from Amazon also.
1366,1,Poor durability,Did not last for even 6 months . No support from Godrej hit inspite of calling helpline(no response) or writing to customer care .Do not buy if you are looking for quality and durability
1367,5,Value for Money,"Good quality. Charged a month ago, still working. Serving the purpose very well."
1368,5,Decent,Works well. Charging light doesnt work. But racquet is okay.
1369,5,The best one around,"Really good product, sturdy and durable. Smash those _____ !"
1370,5,Very good but not excellent,"Battery life is okDurability is goodIf you maintain well it will work very good, coming with 6months of warranty."
1371,5,""" THE REAL MOSQUITO SAVIOR ""","In fact, it is one of the most effectiveMosquito Repellent..TQHIT."
1372,3,Over priced with useless LED light,Disappointed with the LED light. It is not sufficient to kill mosquitos in dark places. Product is overpriced. Earlier bat which I bought locally was perfect for day light and dark places.
1373,5,Very good product,Very nice product. Easy to kill mosquitoes. Light is very cool.
1374,1,Disgusting product & fake warranty promise,"Within 1 month of usage, product is not working now. Claimed the warranty on website, 15 days later still no call/ message regarding replacement.Pathetic service and product.This racquet is such a failure ."
1375,1,Not working just 10 days of purchase,Just used for 10 days now it‚Äôs not working. Registered for warranty now trying to contact customer care but it‚Äôs customer care is also not contactable. Worthless
1376,5,Best mosquito racquet,Very good product. This is my second purchase. Both the racquets are working very fine. Fully satisfied.
1377,1,Waste of money,A week down and it stopped working..charges but then doesnt execute..waste
1378,5,Build quality and battery quality is good,Very good product and quality.Battery is very good longs for 4 days with minimal usage
1379,1,DON'T BUY THIS! NOT RECOMMENDED!,"I ordered this bat 2 months ago and now it's stopped working. It worked just 2 months. Quality is cheap. Utter worst performance. If you're looking for a mosquitoe racquet, please go with another product. Not this one."
1380,4,Very effective,It really works and battery also last for long.
1381,4,Better than average in mosquito bats.,"This has good battery life , you can use for 5 days without recharging.It is durable , and the plastic is good for the given price.At the price of 500 rs it is a good product."
1382,5,"This is Chinese item sold by Godrej, Like AC sold by Godrej","Item is goodBut Even though it's under Godrej brand name, it's NOT Indian, but item imported from CHINA. Think on this point"
1383,4,Good buy,Battery life is not up to mark. the rest is all hood especially the build quality is awesome..
1384,5,Best product,Quality product rather than normal mosquito bats.Battery back up is good.Plastic quality is remarkable.
1385,2,Pathetic,Stop working after two months. I thought it would be the most duralbe one.Very disappointed
1386,1,Stopped working in two months,"Bought it on 14 Feb, by April 20 it was no longer working. It's rattling and it seems like something has come loose inside. It is inexcusable to change this much money for such a terrible product."
1387,1,Not working from day 1,"Delivered today , observed it's is not working. Charged for hours before use and working light just don't turn on."
1388,1,Kindly refrain from the purchase.,My efforts will go in vain .Trust me it does not work. The pin is too small to fit into the the socket.Sturdiness of the product is pathetic .
1389,1,Disappointed,"Highly disappointedMalfunction within 3 weeks of purchase. Stopped working all of a sudden. Have asked for warranty replacement. Let's hope I get responseIf you purchase, please retain warranty card"
1390,1,Stopped working after 15 days,Battery life is only 15 days.Stopped working without any damage.
1391,3,Internal part issue,There is some sound coming from handle seems like batter or other part moving inside freely.
1392,5,Sturdy and effective,"Good product, works well , is sturdy and good ,Im buying a second one today"
1393,1,Received used racquet which wasn't even working. No replacement yet.,"Received a dead racquet, by the looks of it, which was already used by someone. Scartches on the body, and wear and tear.Returned and ask for replacement within 24 hours. Not received replacement, no update from seller. It's been 10 days. Poor product, disappointed with the service."
1394,1,FAKE WARRENTY,I raised the complaint and sent so many emails to HIT customer support but no response from Hit customer care.It's not working after a few months(for me 4 months).
1395,5,Good one,Finally got a rack that does not break and is sturdy. A good buy
1396,5,Wow,Wow
1397,5,Good product & good quality,Good quality product.Overall satisfied.
1398,5,Value for money,The pull push charging system can be made better and smooth
1399,1,Discharged quickly.battery not even lasting for one day,"Discharged in one day,battery life not more than 10 days as described."
1400,1,Not good,After few days started to have problems the mosquito kill rate is 30% I can say after 1 month of use instead of full charge its just like the chap mosquito racket u buy from marke nothing special
1401,1,Charging point blasted,Kept for charging and i cud notice there was blast from the bat and our fuse is also tripped .it's been 20 days now and cudnt retun too.
1402,1,Do not buy this.,"Everything is excellent, except the intended purpose. This bat is incapable of killing mosquitos, do not buy this. Instead,  I suggest buy WeirdWolf Recheargeable bat."
1403,1,Poor quality.. Does not last long... Not money worth,Bad quality and two expensive as it did not lastlong...  Worked Only for 2 and a half months.  Does not work now. Don't go by the brand. Don't buy
1404,5,Nice product must bye,"Nice product from Hit,Build quality look like premium."
1405,1,Only good in looks.,"Very cheap quality materials used, can get easily damaged if dropped once or twice mistakenly."

1474,5,Totally Worth the Price.,This Racquet needs a charge of 4-5hrs and works so perfectly. The battery life is the awesomest feature of this product. It has been a month using it. And I have no complaints. Totally worth the price.
1475,1,Product seals missing.,Used product received. Box seals and products seals were missing. Cellotape strips were applied in a mediocre fashion. Return initiated as there was no replacement option (for my location).

1481,2,Not reliable product.,Couldn't recharge battery after 40 days.
1482,4,Satisfied with the product,"It does work as expected. I have a normal usage. However, the capacitor power is little bit less powerful than what is advertised."
1483,1,Roadside bats are better quality.,Bought this because it is branded. Stopped working within a month. I would've barely used it for a day in that time. Might as well buy same from road side stores.. Those last longer.

1489,1,Battery died in 30 days,"This product stopped working in 30 days, couldn't return now.Product is sturdy, but something to do with battery I guess.Brand name is not helping here, as it stops working in some days."
1490,1,Don't know why,"So far I couldn't kill one mosquito, god knows why, appearance is good but a little heavy. I should have returned it along with the other products I bought with . Now repenting."
1491,1,Review after one month: Don't buy,"The mosquitos don't die at all, when the mosquito is hit, it just makes the bursting noise, but the mosquito flies away and come back and bite you harder üòÑ, so it's like a toy mosquito bat"
1492,5,Very Useful...Value for money...,"It's very sturdy and battery life is also good, but when you charge it for 7 to 8 hours..."
1493,5,Superb,Battery will never die...  It's seems like a quality product. Price is on the upper limit.
1494,5,One hell of a mosquito killer !,Very powerful. Wise design. Well worth the price.Mosquitoes bye bye !
1495,4,It's not working irrespective of charging,"It's not working after one month itself. Item got defect during warranty period, registered for warranty and no reponse from the manufacturer.Modified review.. Item replaced by the seller."

1517,5,Good product,I already have one and purchased one more for my family but received broken so i returned it... Last time i had the same and that is perfectly fine even after an year..

1593,4,Imported from china.,"Just purchased few days ago, so can not comment about battery life. My only concern is it is imported from china. We are ready to pay 10-20% extra if it is made in india"
1594,5,Very excellent and nice product,"Good battery life and strong bat , then masqito kill in 2 sec.And LED light indicator night time we must kill in masqito.Super product and good battery life...üëåüëåüòçüè∏üè∏"
1595,2,Money for Plastic material only,"No doubt  the quality is good and 2 stars are for the plastic quality only. Functionality vise the item is really bad. Doesn‚Äôt kill mosquitoes many times, flies are never ever killed using the racket. Don‚Äôt buy it."
1596,1,Stopped working after 5 months of use,"Never trapped mosquitoes well, local racquets are better than this. It suddenly stopped working after 5 months of purchase. What should I do now??"
1597,1,Worked for 25 days just until return window,Stopped working all of a sudden... Trusted it seeing the name HIT... Thumbs down üëé
1598,5,Best Buy(FAR FAR BETTER THAN OTHERS),I have purchased two and both are working very fine though they r costly but very effective. Must buy if you want to get rid of mosquitoes
1599,5,Product is good,"Product is good got it at Rs 345. Quality of plastic is not that cheap as people here are comparing them with the roadside bat. 6 months warranty is provided which can be registered via online. There is no such use of led light given. Overall, fulfills the purpose."
1600,1,0 battery and not working,Don't buy this product as it's battery life is 0... If I buy for 200 local one is more better than this.
1601,5,Great product at this price,Great product at this price point.
1602,1,Product stopped working after 1 use,"Product stopped working after 1 use, only charging light turns on while charging, everything else stopped working, waste of money!"
1603,5,Very Good,"Lightweight, easy to handle and works very well"
1604,5,impressive backup,The battery backup came for 20 days which is also impressive
1605,1,Not worthy,Trusted on brand HIT. Worked for one and half months. Abruptly stopped working. Very much disappointed. There were other options available even less than the price of HIT. Thought as it is a known brand it will long last. Sad.
1606,2,1 day max battery.,1 day max battery life. Dnt trust the battery life. Else everything is working fine.May be 30 days battery life on single time charge is only if we not use.
1607,5,Best in class #1,"This is the best even though it's review stars are low, it's power to kill mosquitoes & other small annoying insects is amazing. Just go for it, you will enjoy using it..."
1608,4,Anti mosquito racket.,"Nice product strong on the mosquitos, My piece came with a loose noisy battery /circuit."
1609,4,Good build.,Good build. Not too sturdy. Powerful charge killer. Blue light too strong and one-sided.
1610,2,Same other low grade products,No replaceable battery makes these products landfills
1611,2,Product Quality is not the same as I bought the last one,Battery is making noise and its shaking insideLet's see how long it will work
1612,5,"Good, handle with care",Registration process should be replaced with the bill provided. No need to register after receiving the item should be burdened. Keep it simple and reliable.

1614,5,Durable and long battery life,"Its durable and battery life is good.There is an LED, which i don't is of any use.But its a must to have tool."
1615,1,Stopped working on the 3rd day,It stopped working on the 3rd day. I thought its a branded one and i may last for few months. They mentioned 6 months warranty and they haven't mentioned how we can claim the warranty. My suggestion don't buy it seeing the brand.
1616,1,Defective good,We purchased two rackets. One was ok. But other did not have a switch. We started using the first one. When after some time we opened the other one we found it to be defective and so we wanted to get replacement. But by that time widow for replacement was closed.
1617,3,Bad quality,Quality is very low.Battery is dancing inside the bat
1618,5,Use it and kills mosquitoes tension free!,"Forget the Chinese stuff u buy every year and throw in dustbin later, buy it and use for years."
1619,1,Unusual sound while shaking,"It is giving unusual sound from inside. It seems the insides not attached to product properly. I requested to replace new one let‚Äôs see, if new one also has same issue better go for different product"
1620,5,Nice product,Good for home useKiller for mosquito
1621,2,Over priced,The battery stopped working within three months of purchase. The price is very high. I won't recommend buying this.
1622,1,Useless,"Battery capacity is 12hours only.Charging pins are thin, sliding off the socket.Local ones are better than this one. Disappointed"
1623,1,"Useless, no support on warranty",Didn‚Äôt work for even 2 daysTried claiming warranty but it just takes my details no one gets back. Better to buy locel item that costs ‚Çπ150

1637,4,good product,"seems sturdy, holds charge for decent time."
1638,4,Good,It's sturdy and durable. Battery life could have been better.
1639,1,The battery doesn't last long,The racquet just stopped working after a regular charge.
1640,5,Best insect sqatting bat out there..,The best insect quitting bat out there. Have used multiple unmown brand ones. But only this one last better and performs better.
1641,1,Please do not buy!,We bought the racquet despite the bad reviews about non functioning with trust on The brand HIT. But the raquet hardly worked for a week. Please do not buy it.Battery back up is also very low.
1642,1,"Don't buy, not working at all",It didn't work from day 1. Both hit and Amazon are responsible. Amazon delivered to my parents address though I had given my address for delivery. And it didn't work at all. Waste of money
1643,1,Very bad and incompetent,"It won't work. All fly's enjoy timing around. To kill the fly using this bat, fly need to be a peanut size. Returned"
1644,3,But at ur own risk,Over all quality is good  but after use of 15 days..fully charged battery is very fast discharging while we killing mosquitos .. fully charged battery discharged suddenly after using it within 15 minutes

1652,2,Stopped working within 15 days.,"It stopped working within 15 days, i claimed warranty and got second one, it too stopped working within 10 days.Now their website is not even responding."
1653,1,No Warranty Response,Purchased on 7th Mar 2020 & it stopped working after 25 days. Registered complaint on 7th Apr & got no response from the company. This is not expected from a company like Godrej. Just making customers fool by giving warranty.
1654,1,Please dont buy.. The product malfunction within 4 to 5 weeks. The battery is not powerful,"Poor battery life, quality and doesnot works within weeks"
1655,5,Good quality product,Good quality and sturdy product
1656,5,Made in China,"This is a Chinese product, sold by Indian seller"

1658,5,Sturdy and quality product,Using it for last 2 weeks. It is sturdy and build quality looks good compared to other unbranded ones. Tried this after using few unbranded which didn‚Äôt last long. Happy so far.
1659,1,Worst bat. Have to force mosquitoes into it to kill.,This bat is useless. I have lost the joy of squatting mosquitoes compared to other bats. Only the inner mesh has current. The outer mesh is dummy and helps the mosquitoes escape on contact. Not sure if defective.

1666,5,Awesome,Excellent is the word.. its really feel good when you realise that you have chosen a quality product

1673,5,Good product.,No batteries required. Device works well for a long time after a single charge. Has a night light (blue colour).
1674,1,Waste,Not value for money...... Not working after  4-5 months...... Charging pin is also not suitable
1675,1,Got used product,After using just one day product stopped working at all. I guess the product was refurbished or defective. Didn‚Äôt expected this from Amazon. Bad show

1677,5,Nice Product,Best Product available in Indian Market by a reliable Indian Brand. Simply the best.

1679,5,Best,Have purchased a second one..
1680,1,Not worth,Not even last for one week. Worst customer service. Called several times. Asking to take the product to their service center.
1681,5,Good option,Easy to use and battery life is also good.
1682,1,Stopped working,Stopped working after 3 charges. It's dead. How can I recieve replacement as the product page says 6 months warranty.
1683,1,Not working ordered replacement on 23rd Dec still waiting,Battery üîã is not charging asked for a replacement or return on 23rd Dec. Srill waiting for a response from Amazon / seller.
1684,5,"Really good ,go for it",If you charge it well the battery last for atleast 2 days without charging
1685,1,Bat not working,Mosquito racket is not working. The bat is not being charged. It is not working from 6th of SeptemberPkbag
1686,4,GODREJ  gives quality products,"Good and very efficient in killing mosquitos and small flies. BATTERY Life, Sturdiness and Durability also GOOD."
1687,4,Good and Effective,V good product..works for many days once charged..
1688,5,Best Product,Best raquet which you can buy. Durable & have warrenty. But make sure to register it online for warrenty as soon as you get this prosuct otherwise you will loose the benifit.

1696,5,Beat racket ever,It's been almost over a month since I charged. Price is little expensive but does a great job. Must have product in every home.
1697,1,This will not work,"I purchased this product but not used for three to four months , when the time come to use it is not worked. I feel so bad , after I purchased this product by my hard earning . I was very upset"
1698,4,Quality,The mosquito racquet is good and works well. The quality of the net and it‚Äôs battery is good when compared to other racquet I‚Äôm the market but don‚Äôt expect the racquet to run more than 2 years.
1699,1,Not a good quality,Bad quality when received something was loose inside like battery.
1700,4,Can be more strong for the price quoted..,The mosquito bat is good but coming to the price part it's on higher side..The working condition is good but it fell down and from that time some part inside used to make noise..
1701,5,Good buy bye-bye,Good and working 5 months review
1702,1,Very wost don't buy,Very worst don't buy products waste of money. It's not working with 10 days from am brought. So be aware like that product. Amazon spoiling brand name. For like this products selling.

1706,1,Got defective product,"1st time received defective product..so returned...for 2nd time delivery, Amazon  found the product as defective..so didnt deliver..and did the cash back.."

1708,5,Very effective product,Wow...great product.. works very well...battery retains charge for a week
1709,1,Stopped working in 2-3 uses,I thought since it‚Äôs from Hit brand it will last. But it stopped working in only a few days. Do not waste your money
1710,4,To hit the mosquito Hit Bat is perfectly ok,Bettery life is goodAll fineNice product to buyLight given in the bat is helpful during lights off
1711,5,No warranty logically,My product didn't work just after 2 months even we cared the product with ultimate care and since am unable to register warranty at that time of purchase now what can I do ?

1719,2,Plug pin wonky,On arrival the charging plug pin was defective (one pin shorter than the other) so returned the item a week ago and a replacement not yet shipped. Probably best to ask for a refund than a replacement.
1720,5,Useful and good one,Battery life and over all quality is too good. Better to go for this insted of little cheap bats available in market
1721,4,Value for money.,Good product. Long battery life. Looks durable also.
1722,1,Warranty is bogus!!!,Bought 2 bats both stopped working in 2 weeks. Warranty is bogus!!! Was very disappointed with the product. Bought a local mosquito bat at near by shop for rs.150 that's working very fine for the past 4 months.
1723,5,It's Nice,This products is good. I am using for last 4 months.  No issues as of now. The blue light is very attractive.

1733,1,Useless item,Useless bat.. i recvd this bat that was deffected.. when they replaced it.. they sent us such a bat which was having issue of battery... Such a fake item.
1734,1,Dont get tempted to buy with the looks of the sleek finish.,Not worth it.Battery life only 10 to 15 minutes after charging. Mosquitoes are just passing freely in and out.Ordinary bats which costs around 200 functions better.Warranty looks name sake.No one has responded after registering claim.
1735,4,Worth the price,"Overall experience nice, battery performance good, 8-9 months expected product life. Buy 2nd one, works better than other available products in the market"
1736,1,Bad product bad service,No customer service. No one is repairing. Bad quality.

1752,1,"Horrible battery life, there is no option to rate below one",Worst product I have come across. Need to charge every time after killing few mosquitoes.  More than killing mosquitoes most of the time it has to be plugged and charged.
1753,1,Plug-in design is unreliable,The plug for charging always keeps going back in... It happened even after plugging in and the racquet fell down and it started making noises and random shocks on its own
1754,1,STOPPED WORKING,"Bought this product on 8th October ‚Äò20.Today is 7th dec ‚Äò20 and it has stopped working. So, worked for a total of 2 months.Thanks, hit :)Duck you."

1761,1,Died up after 2 weeks,Even after taking all the care of keeping it in off while charging the product has now stopped working. It only shows the charging indicator apart from that nothing works
1762,1,Only works for a few days,This racquet only works for a few days and then burns out. Inspite of charging adequately if fails to zap mosquitoes. Better to buy a mosquito repellent

1764,4,Gud satisfied,"Gud satisfied with the product, Good when compared with market product"
1765,1,Disappointing,This thing only lasted a month. It was not even heavily used. After a month it just stopped working. Only the LED light is working now. Not expected from a popular brand like HIT.
1766,4,Nice one,"Good product, received in good condition, no damage"
1767,1,Worth for the money or not,Not worth the money. Noise coming from the bat after 3 days or something. Quality is not so great. For the price it's not worth

1777,3,It broke after a week,"as at one place, it just keeps sparking without even any contact with insects."
1778,5,Good buy,Worth buying
1779,3,Originated in China.,"It works fine, easy to use. Looks robust. It‚Äôs a Indian company but this product is made in China. Otherwise a good product."

2550,4,Button is a bit hard to switch on and off,Button is a bit hard to switch on and off
2551,5,Awesome Product,"Might seem a bit expensive compared to others on offer, but coming from a reputed brand shows the difference in sturdiness,  battery life."

2660,2,Normal,Its like any other product don't get fooled by hit branding as its on only sticker  it's made in China by some other company
2661,4,Good,Good but you have to kill mosquito manually by hands like playing badminton
2662,1,Lasted 8 months,Lasted for just 8 months. LED function is absolutely useless.
2663,4,not so effective as expected,not so effective
2664,5,üëç,üëç
2665,1,Better to buy this than other China Bazaar Products,Burnt the first time we put it for charging.
2666,1,Poor battery life,I have 2bats.i buy only hit product. But the latest purchase was dissatisfaction. I use this product on daily basis. Poor battery life not even 1 hr
2667,4,Kill those mosquitos...,Price is higher but ok for the quality it offers ...
2668,1,Faulty Product,Battery did not work from day 1. even after multiple charging battery drains out in minutes...But amazon was great in terms of refund process

2670,1,"Within 1.5month use ,the racket stop working","As this is Hit product ,I was expecting for better durability but within 1.5month the racket stop working!I am very unhappy about the product"
2671,1,The battery life is so poor,It's a matter of chance that how long this racket will work. It can go bad in 10 -15 days also. N to claim warranty is a difficult task in it
2672,5,Convenient,Gud sturdy product
2673,1,Very bad review,Worst warranty service got. Finally thrown the racquet.
2674,1,The bat will stop working within less time. It's not durable upto 10 days also for me,Within 10 days hit bat has stopped working and I tried to claim warranty but no use. Totally waste of money. Don't ruin your money by buying this item

2680,5,Best in this ....,"Main thing is durability of ABS tempt me to second one, better buying local unit for temporary go for it u will not be dissatisfied."
2681,2,Why not to buy racquet,Earlier it cost was low and now it cost high so it will be preferable to buy from any electronic shop as we can get at cheaper price
2682,3,Mosquito bat,It is definitely not easy to use.  Mosquitoes or flies fly past them and you need to hunt them down. HIT spray is better and effective
2683,1,Faulty within 5 months,How to claim the warranty. The racket got short within 5 months. Flashing whenever I press the power button
2684,2,Not durable,"The racquet stopped working after a couple of months of use. Charging the racquet turns on the LED light, but it doesn't work when unplugged."
2685,5,Rupees Worth spending,Very good product & far better than Chinese ones . Worth spending 500rs than buying unwarranted products for 150 or 200 rs. Battery life is also good.
2686,1,Not working,It's not working in 2 days.. how do I get warranty?

2694,5,serves it's purpose,It's sturdy and serves it's purpose
2695,3,Average quality product,You have to repair every time
2696,2,Battery life is not good,Better is not so good even after charging it 2 hours stopped working after couple of minutes.
2697,5,Good product,Very useful

2699,2,Charging is difficult,"Every thing is fine but when ever I put on the plug for charge, it keeps falling and it's unable to charge also it will get damaged soo as it's keeps falling"
